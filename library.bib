abstract = {The importance of soil organic matter (SOM) in the global carbon (C) cycle has been highlighted by many studies, but the way in which SOM stabilization processes and chemical composition affect decomposition rates under natural climatic conditions is not yet well understood. To relate the temperature sensitivity of heterotrophic soil respiration to the decomposition potential of SOM, we compared temperature sensitivities of respiration rates from a 2-year long soil translocation experiment from four elevations along a similar to 3000 m tropical forest gradient. We determined SOM stabilization mechanisms and the molecular structure of soil C from different horizons collected before and after the translocation. Soil samples were analysed by physical fractionation procedures, (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The temperature sensitivity (Q (10)) of heterotrophic soil respiration at the four sites along the elevation transect did not correlate with either the available amount of SOM or its chemical structure. Only the relative distribution of C into physical soil fractions correlated with Q (10) values. We therefore conclude that physical fractionation of soil samples is the most appropriate way to assess the temperature sensitivity of SOM.},

abstract = {Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition in humid tropical regions may exacerbate phosphorus (P) deficiency in forests on highly weathered soils. However, it is not clear how P availability affects soil microbes and soil carbon (C), or how P processes interact with N deposition in tropical forests. We examined the effects of N and P additions on soil microbes and soil C pools in a N-saturated old-growth tropical forest in southern China to test the hypotheses that (1) N and P addition will have opposing effects on soil microbial biomass and activity, (2) N and P addition will alter the composition of the microbial community, (3) the addition of N and P will have interactive effects on soil microbes and (4) addition-mediated changes in microbial communities would feed back on soil C pools. Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis was used to quantify the soil microbial community following four treatments: Control, N addition (15 g N m(-2) yr(-1)), P addition (15 g P m(-2) yr(-1)), and N{\&}P addition (15 g N m(-2) yr(-1) plus 15 g P m(-2) yr(-1)). These were applied from 2007 to 2011. Whereas additions of P increased soil microbial biomass, additions of N reduced soil microbial biomass. These effects, however, were transient, disappearing over longer periods. Moreover, N additions significantly increased relative abundance of fungal PLFAs and P additions significantly increased relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi PLFAs. Nitrogen addition had a negative effect on light fraction C, but no effect on heavy fraction C and total soil C. In contrast, P addition significantly decreased both light fraction C and total soil C. However, there were no interactions between N addition and P addition on soil microbes. Our results suggest that these nutrients are not co-limiting, and that P rather than N is limiting in this tropical forest.},

abstract = {We report results from a large-scale nutrient fertilization experiment along a "megadiverse" (154 unique species were included in the study) 3,000-m elevation transect in the Peruvian Andes and adjacent lowland Amazonia. Our objectives were to test if nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation shift along this elevation gradient, and to determine how an alleviation of nutrient limitation would manifest in ecosystem changes. Tree height decreased with increasing elevation, but leaf area index (LAI) and diameter at breast height (DBH) did not vary with elevation. Leaf N:P decreased with increasing elevation (from 24 at 200 m to 11 at 3,000 m), suggesting increased N limitation and decreased P limitation with increasing elevation. After 4 years of fertilization (N, P, N + P), plots at the lowland site (200 m) fertilized with N + P showed greater relative growth rates in DBH than did the control plots; no significant differences were evident at the 1,000 m site, and plots fertilized with N at the highest elevation sites (1,500, 3,000 m) showed greater relative growth rates in DBH than did the control plots, again suggesting increased N constraint with elevation. Across elevations in general N fertilization led to an increase in microbial respiration, while P and N + P addition led to an increase in root respiration and corresponding decrease in hyphal respiration. There was no significant canopy response (LAI, leaf nutrients) to fertilization, suggesting that photosynthetic capacity was not N or P limited in these ecosystems. In sum, our study significantly advances ecological understanding of nutrient cycling and ecosystem response in a region where our collective knowledge and data are sparse: we demonstrate N limitation in high elevation tropical montane forests, N and P co-limitation in lowland Amazonia, and a nutrient limitation response manifested not in canopy changes, but rather in stem and belowground changes.},

abstract = {Climate change may affect hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae (ex-Scrophulariaceae) both directly through impacts on hemiparasite physiology and indirectly through impacts on host plants. This dual action suggests particular sensitivity of the parasite to climate change and any associated impacts on hosts and other members of the community. While little research has addressed the responses of parasitic plants to climate change in natural environments, impacts are predicted from controlled environment studies together with a knowledge of the key ecophysiological traits of hemiparasitic Orobanchaceae, in particular of Striga species, which are important weeds in semi-arid tropical agro-ecosystems, and Rhinanthus species, which can be important components of (principally) grassland communities in the northern temperate zone. The main mode of action of both elevated CO2 and warming will be through changes in photosynthesis and stomatal functioning. Enhanced photosynthesis of the hemiparasite and host will increase parasite carbon gains but may also increase the demand for host mineral nutrients. Mineral nutrition may, therefore, mediate the impacts of climate change on host-parasite associations. The relative insensitivity of hemiparasite stomata to elevated CO2 suggests that high stomatal conductances may be maintained and thus solute uptake may become limited by soil drying driven by higher rates of evapotranspiration and reduced precipitation. Climate change impacts on host-parasite interactions at the individual level will ultimately affect hemiparasite impacts at the community level. Community impacts will be greatest where climate change considerably favours hemiparasite populations or, conversely, causes them to disappear from communities where they were formerly abundant. Impacts will further be mediated by climate impacts on hosts, and the natural enemies of hosts and parasites alike. Further, the wide host range of many root hemiparasitic plants may facilitate migration of their populations through new communities under a changing climate.},

abstract = {Tropical forests contain a large stock of soil carbon, but the factors that constrain its mineralization remain poorly understood. Microorganisms, when stimulated by the presence of new inputs of labile organic carbon, can mineralize ('prime') soil organic matter to acquire nutrients. We used stable carbon isotopes to assess how nutrient demand and soil properties constrain mineralization of added labile (sucrose) carbon and pre-existing (primed) soil carbon in tropical forest soils. In a series of lowland tropical forest soils from Panama, we found that the mineralization of fresh labile carbon was accelerated foremost by phosphorus addition, whereas the mineralization of pre-existing soil carbon was constrained foremost by nitrogen addition. However, there was variation in the relative importance of these nutrients in different soils and the largest effects on the acceleration of sucrose metabolism and constraint of priming occurred following the addition of nitrogen and phosphorus together. The respiration responses due to sucrose or primed soil carbon mineralization were reduced at pH below 4.8 and above 6.0. We conclude that in these tropical forest soils, phosphorus availability is more important in promoting microbial mineralization of sucrose carbon, whereas nitrogen availability is more important in constraining the priming of pre-existing soil organic carbon. This response likely arises because nitrogen is more closely coupled to organic matter cycling, whereas phosphorus is abundant in both organic and inorganic forms. These results suggest that the greatest impact of priming on soil carbon stocks will occur in moderately acidic tropical forest soils of low nitrogen availability. Given long-term changes in both atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrogen deposition, the impact of priming effects on soil carbon in tropical forest soils may be partially constrained by the abundance of nitrogen.},

abstract = {Priming is an increase in soil organic carbon decomposition following input of labile organic carbon. In temperate soils where biological activity is limited commonly by nitrogen availability, priming is expected to occur through microbial acquisition of nitrogen from organic matter or stimulated activity of recalcitrant-carbon degrading microorganisms. However, these priming mechanisms have not yet been assessed in strongly weathered tropical forest soils where biological activity is often limited by the availability of phosphorus. We examined whether microbial nutrient limitation or community dynamics drive priming in three lowland tropical forest soils of contrasting fertility ('low', 'mid' and 'high') by applying C4-sucrose (alone or in combination with nutrients; nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium) and measuring (1) the $\delta$13C-signatures in respired CO2 and in phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarkers, and (2) the activities of enzymes involved in nitrogen (N-acetyl $\beta$-glucosaminidase), phosphorus (phosphomonoesterase) and carbon ($\beta$-glucosidase, cellobiohydrolase, xylanase, phenol oxidase) acquisition from organic compounds. Priming was constrained in part by nutrient availability, because priming was greater when sucrose was added alone compared to when added with nutrients. However, the greatest priming with sucrose addition alone was detected in the medium fertility soil. Priming occurred in parallel with stimulated activity of phosphomonoesterase and phenol oxidase (but not N-acetyl $\beta$-glucosaminidase); when sucrose was added with nutrients there were lower activities of phosphomonoesterase and phenol oxidase. There was no evidence according to PLFA $\delta$13C-incorporation that priming was caused by specific groups of recalcitrant-carbon degrading microorganisms. We conclude that priming occurred in the intermediate fertility soil following microbial mineralization of organic nutrients (phosphorus in particular) and suggest that priming was constrained in the high fertility soil by high nutrient availability and in the low fertility soil by the low concentration of soil organic matter amenable to priming. This first study of priming mechanisms in tropical forest soils indicates that input of labile carbon can result in priming by microbial mineralization of organic nutrients, which has important implications for understanding the fate of organic carbon in tropical forest soils. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The carbon-isotopic composition (d13C) of soil-respired CO2 has been employed to evaluate soil carbon-cycling processes and the contribution of soil CO2 emissions to canopy and tropospheric air. These evaluations can be successful only when accurate isotope values of soil-respired CO2 are available. Here, we tested the robustness of d13C values of soil-respired CO2 obtained after long incubations in static closed chambers that were initially flushed with soil air. The rationale of this approach is that the equilibrium carbon-isotope values of chamber-headspace CO2 are theoretically equal to those of CO2 produced within the soil. Static closed chambers were installed in replicated grass monocultures, and measurements of headspace CO2 concentrations and d13C values were performed at regular time intervals for 24h in July 2005. The results revealed no significant effects of grass species on headspaceCO2 concentrations or d13Cvalues (repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), P{\textgreater}0.1). As predicted by theory, isotope values asymptotically approached equilibrium conditions, which in our experimental setting occurred after 10 h. This good match between model predictions and our results suggests that an accurate determination of d13C values of CO2 produced within soils is obtained through the isotopic measurement of chamber-headspace CO2 once equi- librium conditions have been reached with the underlying soils. An additional advantage of this approach is that only one sample per chamber is required, which, combined with the low uncer- tainties of these measurements, facilitates the investigation of the spatial (landscape) variability of soil-respired CO2.},

abstract = {Nutrient enrichment is increasingly affecting many tropical ecosystems, but there is no information on how this affects tree biodiversity. To examine dynamics in vegetation structure and tree species biomass and diversity, we annually remeasured tree species before and for six years after repeated additions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in permanent plots of abandoned pasture in Amazonia. Nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, phosphorus addition shifted growth among woody species. Nitrogen stimulated growth of two common pioneer tree species and one common tree species adaptable to both high-and low-light environments, while P stimulated growth only of the dominant pioneer tree Rollinia exsucca (Annonaceae). Overall, N or P addition reduced tree assemblage evenness and delayed tree species accrual over time, likely due to competitive monopolization of other resources by the few tree species responding to nutrient enrichment with enhanced establishment and/or growth rates. Absolute tree growth rates were elevated for two years after nutrient addition. However, nutrient-induced shifts in relative tree species growth and reduced assemblage evenness persisted for more than three years after nutrient addition, favoring two nutrient-responsive pioneers and one early-secondary tree species. Surprisingly, N + P effects on tree biomass and species diversity were consistently weaker than N-only and P-only effects, because grass biomass increased dramatically in response to N + P addition. The resulting intensified competition probably prevented an expected positive N + P synergy in the tree assemblage. Thus, N or P enrichment may favor unknown tree functional response types, reduce the diversity of coexisting species, and delay species accrual during structurally and functionally complex tropical rainforest secondary succession.},

In part, this knowledge gap arises from the marked complexity of the tropical forest biome, in which nitrogen, phosphorus, and perhaps several other elements may play roles in determining rates of C gain and loss. As stud- ies from other ecosystems show, failing to account for nutrientC interactions can lead to substantial errors in predicting how ecosystems will respond to climate and other environmental changes. Thus, although resolving the complex nature of tropical forest nutrient limitation and then incorporating such knowledge into predic- tive models will be difficult, it is a challenge that the global change community must address.},

abstract = {Rainforests occur in high precipitation areas of eastern Australia, along a gradient in seasonality of precipitation, ranging from a summer dry season in the temperate south to a winter dry season in the tropical north. The response of net photosynthesis to increasing vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was measured in a range of Australian rainforest trees from different latitudes to investigate possible differences in their response to atmospheric drought. Plants were grown in glasshouses under ambient or low VPD to determine the effect of growth VPD on the photosynthetic response. Temperate species, which experience low summer precipitation, were found to maintain maximum net photosynthesis over the measurement range of VPD (0.5-1.9 kPa). In contrast, the tropical species from climates with high summer precipitation showed large reductions in net photosynthesis with increasing VPD. Temperate species showed higher intrinsic water-use efficiencies under low VPD than the tropical species, whereas their efficiencies were similar under high VPD. Growing plants under a low VPD had little effect on either the photosynthetic response to VPD or the intrinsic water-use efficiency of the species. These different responses of gas exchange to VPD shown by the tropical and temperate rainforest species may reflect different strategies to maximise productivity in their respective climates.},

abstract = {Leaf quality (nutrient concentration) and herbivory were studied in a set of dominant tree species in regenerat- ing, secondary tropical dry forests growing on limestone in the Yucata ´n Peninsula. The study's objective was to assess how variation in nutrient availability affects leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations and herbivory. Our study included an area of young forest (10 y old), with phosphorus-poor soils, and an area of old forest (?60 y old), in which soil P was comparatively less limiting. The foliage of representative species of each site was studied, including Acacia gaumeri, Leucaena leucocephala and Lysiloma latisiliquum at the young forest site, and A. gaumeri, Bursera simaruba and Pithecellobium dulce at the old forest. Four independent plots (12 × 12 m) at each forest were either left intact (controls) or fertilized with N, with P, or with N plus P for three consecutive years. Relaxation of nutrient limitations at the young forest resulted in an increase in leaf phosphorus and herbivory in all species. In contrast, N and P fertiliza- tion at the old forest site did not consistently affect leaf nutrient concentration and leaf damage. In this site the main response to fertilization was an increase in leaf nitrogen only in B. simaruba and an increase in herbivory in A. gaumeri; leaf phosphorus was unaffected by soil fertilization. Overall, we observed that, subsequent to nutrient addition, leaf phosphorus concentration and herbivory in the leguminous species increased at the young site; leaf nitrogen concentra- tion in the non-leguminous species increased at the old site while herbivory only increased in A. gaumeri, following a pattern similar to that observed in the young site. We conclude that the regulatory mechanisms of leaf quality and damage by herbivores will vary, depending on the details of the site's nutrient limitations and the identity of species.},

abstract = {Response of soil respiration (CO2 emission) to simulated nitrogen (N) deposition in a mature tropical forest in southern China was studied from October 2005 to September 2006. The objective was to test the hypothesis that N addition would reduce soil respiration in N saturated tropical forests. Static chamber and gas chromatography techniques were used to quantify the soil respiration, following four-level sof N treatments (Control, no N addition; Low-N, 5 g N m-2yr-1; Medium-N, 10 g N m-2yr-1; and High-N, 15 g N m-2 yr-1 experimental inputs), which had been applied for 26 months before and continued throughout the respiration measurement period. Results showed that soil respiration exhibited a strong seasonal pattern, with the highest rates found in the warm and wet growing season (April-September) and the lowest rates in the dry dormant season (December-February). Soil respiration rates showed a significant positive exponential relationship with soil temperature, whereas soil moisture only affect soil respiration at dry conditions in the dormant season. Annual accumulative soil respiration was 601 ± 30 g CO2-Cm-2yr-1 in the Controls. Annual mean soil respiration rate in the Control, Low-N and Medium-N treatments (69 ± 3, 72 ± 3 and 63 ± 1 mg CO2- Cm-2h-1, respectively) did not differ significantly, whereas it was 14{\%} lower in the High-N treatment (58 ±3 mg CO2-Cm-2h-1) compared with the Control treatment, also the temperature sensitivity of respiration, Q10 was reduced from 2.6 in the Control with 2.2 in the High-N treatment. The decrease in soil respiration occurred in the warm and wet growing season and were correlated with a decrease in soil microbial activities and in fine root biomass in the N-treated plots. Our results suggest that response of soil respiration to atmospheric N deposition in tropical forests is a decline, but it may vary depending on the rate of N deposition. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The majority of the Earth's terrestrial carbon is stored in the soil. If anthropogenic warming stimulates the loss of this carbon to the atmosphere, it could drive further planetary warming1–4. Despite evidence that warming enhances carbon fluxes to and from the soil5,6, the net global balance between these responses remains uncertain. Here we present a comprehensive analysis of warming- induced changes in soil carbon stocks by assembling data from 49 field experiments located across North America, Europe and Asia. We find that the effects of warming are contingent on the size of the initial soil carbon stock, with considerable losses occurring in high-latitude areas. By extrapolating this empirical relationship to the global scale, we provide estimates of soil carbon sensitivity to warming that may help to constrain Earth system model projections. Our empirical relationship suggests that global soil carbon stocks in the upper soil horizons will fall by 30 ± 30 petagrams of carbon to 203 ± 161 petagrams of carbon under one degree of warming, depending on the rate at which the effects of warming are realized. Under the conservative assumption that the response of soil carbon to warming occurs within a year, a business-as-usual climate scenario would drive the loss of 55 ± 50 petagrams of carbon from the upper soil horizons by 2050. This value is around 12–17 per cent of the expected anthropogenic emissions over this period7,8. Despite the considerable uncertainty in our estimates, the direction of the global soil carbon response is consistent across all scenarios. This provides strong empirical support for the idea that rising temperatures will stimulate the net loss of soil carbon to the atmosphere, driving a positive land carbon–climate feedback that could accelerate climate change.},

abstract = {The global carbon cycle is being perturbed by changes in land-use, especially in the tropics. This chapter compares surface soil organic carbon stocks, carbon mineralization rates and soil CO(2) efflux between an undisturbed forest and a clearing at Barro Colorado Island and between a pasture and plantation at Sardinilla, Central Panama. Our results on C cycling at two study sites with contrasting parent material and soil type were compared with other studies throughout the moist tropics. Differences in soil carbon stocks in the topsoil (0-5 cm) of the clearing (15 Mg C ha(-1)) and the undisturbed forest site (22 Mg C ha(-1)) were statistically not significant. Our inventory revealed that the highest carbon stock (29 Mg C ha(-1)) was found under the native tree plantation, although at least part of this high value is site-related. Thus, no carbon change could be detected two years after the conversion of the site from a pasture into a native tree plantation. Soil CO(2) efflux rates at the pasture site (8 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1)) were significantly higher than in forest, clearing and plantation (5-6 mu mol CO(2) m(-2) s(-1)). Large CO(2) flux rates in the pasture might be explained by high belowground biomass production which leads to high root respiration rates. Our incubation experiment showed that pasture and clearing soil had a higher proportion of active pool carbon than plantation and forest. Higher amounts of active pool C indicate the existence of carbon readily mineralizable by microbes. Our results demonstrate that the active pool C is a good predictor of soil respiration. Thus, active soil organic carbon is a sensitive indicator for changes in soil organic carbon following land use change.},

abstract = {Germination provides many potentially unrecognized sources of variation in the regeneration niche. In this study we relate germination requirements and seed size for 16 species of pioneer trees to microclimatic conditions present in gaps in semi-deciduous rain forest in Panama. We found that, whereas increased duration of direct irradiance can be an effective indicator of the presence of a canopy gap across all scales of canopy openness, diel fluctuations in soil temperature effectively discriminate both understory sites and small gaps (25 M2) from larger gaps. Germination response was significantly related to seed size. Small-seeded species (seed mass {\textless}2 mg) showed significantly greater germination in response to irradiance of 22.3 [Lmol.m-2-s-' than in complete darkness. Their germination was unaffected by an increasing magnitude of diel temperature fluctuation up to a species-specific threshold, above which it declined. Large-seeded species (seed mass {\textgreater}2 mg) germinated equally in light and darkness (with one exception) and either showed a positive germination response to an increasing magnitude of temperature fluctuation (four species) or no significant response (four species). The maximum seed burial depth from which seedlings could emerge successfully was strongly positively associated with seed mass. We conclude that photoblastic germination of tropical pioneer trees results in small-seeded species germinating in gaps only when seeds are located in microsites that are suitable for seedling emergence. A positive germination response to increasing temperature fluctuation can stimulate germination of larger-seeded species in larger gaps and when they are buried beneath an opaque soil or litter layer. Therefore, seed size differences constrain the physiological mechanisms of canopy gap detection in tropical pioneer trees and might contribute to observed differences in the distribution of adult plants in relation to canopy gap size.},

abstract = {While most models describing soil organic matter dynamics relate the turnover of soil organic matter to its chemical structure, there is increasing evidence that microbial accessibility to the organic matter is predominant in controlling its stability and its decay. This finding has major implications for forecasting the impacts of land management and climate change on soil organic carbon cycling and there is a need for further research to understand the role of microbial accessibility. Further progress is problematic because of difficulties in partitioning total soil respiration (RS) into its components soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) and soil autotrophic respiration (RA) in undisturbed ecosystems. To overcome this problem, we used an improved natural abundance of13C technique to partition RSinto RHand RAat one and six months after irrigation and addition of nitrogen fertiliser treatments was imposed in a grassland ecosystem.Addition of nitrogen had no significant effect on the components of soil respiration compared with the values for the control. Irrigation resulted in differential effects on RHand RA, leading to strong differences in the proportion of RHcontributing to RS(fRH) with (mean ± standard error) 0.65 ± 0.09 and 0.30 ± 0.06 for the non-irrigated and irrigated plots, respectively, six months after the treatments began. RSand RAwere strongly correlated and both showed strong linear relationships with gravimetric soil water content (WS) resulting in strong differences between irrigation treatments. Soil temperature (TS) and the amount of dissolved organic carbon were also correlated with both RSand RA. In contrast, RHwas not related to variation in WSand TSbut was correlated with the amounts of particulate organic matter carbon, a labile fraction of carbon defined as physically unprotected, and specific surface area, an indicator of soil protection capacity. There were, however, no differences in the labile carbon fraction and specific surface area between the irrigation treatments. We showed that RHwas insensitive to irrigation and remained constant throughout the entire experimental period with a mean value of 1.7 ± 0.2 $\mu$mol m2s-1.Our findings support for the growing evidence that microbial accessibility to substrate, rather than its chemical structure, is predominant in regulating soil organic matter decomposition.},

abstract = {Currently, 279 barnacle species are recognized in Australia waters. The barnacle fauna of tropical Australia exhibits high species diversity (221), with a high incidence of tropical species (87 Indo-west Pacific [IWP], 16 West Pacific and 65 Indo-Malayan), a low species endemicity (8), and 44 cosmopolitan and 1 Australasian species. Conversely, that of temperate Australia shows lower species diversity (129), with a lower incidence of tropical species (26 IWP, 10 West Pacific and 25 Indo-Malayan), higher species endemicity (23), 37 cosmopolitan, 6 Australasian species, and 3 Australasian/Antarctic species. Distributions corroborate the general patterns demonstrated by the shallow-water biota of northern tropical and southern temperate Australian biogeographic provinces. Tropical and temperate provinces grade into each other in a broad overlap zone along both the western and eastern Australian coasts. This overlap zone is essentially a transitional region, with the gradual replacement of a tropical barnacle fauna in the north by a predom- inantly temperate barnacle fauna in the south. Both western and eastern Australian coasts are bounded by major poleward-flowing warm currents that have considerable influence on the marine flora and fauna, distributing tropical species of many taxa much farther south than could be predicted by latitude. Currently, 16 barnacle species introduced into Australian waters are identified, although this number may increase in the future due to new port developments and increased shipping arrivals.},

abstract = {We investigated how photosynthesis by understory seedlings of the lowland tropical tree species Alseis blackiana responded to 10 years of soil nutrient fertilization with N, P and K. We ask whether nutrients are limiting to light and CO(2) acquisition in a low light understory environment. We measured foliar nutrient concentrations of N, P and K, isotopic composition of carbon ($\delta$(13)C) and nitrogen ($\delta$(15)N), and light response curves of photosynthesis and chlorophyll fluorescence. Canopy openness was measured above each study seedling and included in statistical analyses to account for variation in light availability. Foliar N concentration increased by 20{\%} with N addition. Foliar P concentration increased by 78{\%} with P addition and decreased by 14{\%} with N addition. Foliar K increased by 8{\%} with K addition. Foliar $\delta$(13)C showed no significant responses, and foliar $\delta$(15)N decreased strongly with N addition, matching the low $\delta$(15)N values of applied fertilizer. Canopy openness ranged from 0.01 to 6.71{\%} with a mean of 1.76 ± 0.14 (± 1SE). Maximum photosynthetic CO(2) assimilation rate increased by 9{\%} with N addition. Stomatal conductance increased with P addition and with P and K in combination. Chlorophyll fluorescence measurements revealed that quantum yield of photosystem II increased with K addition, maximum electron transport rate trended 9{\%} greater with N addition (p = 0.07), and saturating photosynthetically active radiation increased with N addition. The results demonstrate that nutrient addition can enhance photosynthetic processes, even under low light availability.},

This study aimed to assess whether the leaf structure of Ipomoea nil changes due to climatic variations and whether these changes affect the species' sensitivity. Field exposures, in different seasons (winter and spring) were made. The leaves that developed during the winter were thinner, with a lower proportion of photosynthetic tissues, higher proportion of intercellular spaces and lower density and stomatal index compared to those developed during the spring. The temperature and relative humidity positively influenced the leaf thickness and stomatal index. The visible injuries during winter were positively correlated with the palisade parenchyma thickness and negatively correlated with the percentage of spongy parenchyma; during the spring, the symptoms were positively correlated with the stomatal density. In conclusion, the leaf structure of I. nil varied among the seasons, interfering in its sensitivity to O3.},

abstract = {Understanding nutrient limitation of net primary productivity (NPP) is critical to predict how plant communities will respond to environmental change. Foliar nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations ([N] and [P]) and their ratio, have been used widely as indicators of plant nutritional status and have been linked directly to nutrient limitation of NPP. In tropical systems, however, a high number of confounding factors can limit the ability to predict nutrient limitation--as defined mechanistically by NPP responses to fertilization--based on the stoichiometric signal of the plant community. We used a long-term full factorial N and P fertilization experiment in a lowland tropical wet forest in Costa Rica to explore how tissue (foliar, litter and root) [N] and [P] changed with fertilization, how different tree size classes and taxa influenced the community response, and how tissue nutrients related to NPP. Consistent with NPP responses to fertilization, there were no changes in community-wide foliar [N] and [P], two years after fertilization. Nevertheless, litterfall [N] increased with N additions and root [P] increased with P additions. The most common tree species (Pentaclethra macroloba) had 9{\%} higher mean foliar [N] with NP additions and the most common palm species (Socratea exohrriza) had 15{\%} and 19{\%} higher mean foliar [P] with P and NP additions, respectively. Moreover, N:P ratios were not indicative of NPP responses to fertilization, either at the community or at the taxa level. Our study suggests that in these diverse tropical forests, tissue [N] and [P] are driven by the interaction of multiple factors and are not always indicative of the nutritional status of the plant community.},

abstract = {In the 'elfin' cloud forest of Serrania de Macuira, exchangeable ammonium and nitrate, and the rates of soil nitrogen mineralization and nitrification were measured in soil samples under different water, temperature and mineral nutrient additions. The effects of nitrogen, phosphorus and nitrogen plus phosphorus fertilization on radial trunk growth were measured in three tree species. In the cloud forest soils, concentrations of ammonium were much higher than those of nitrate. Nitrate was higher in samples collected during the afternoon than during the morning, probably as a result of leaching during the night or nitrification during the day. When samples were incubated under different water and temperature treatments, rates of nitrogen mineralization and nitrification increased more with changes in soil water content than with changes in temperature. Nitrification was significantly increased in soils amended with ammonium or with ammonium plus phosphorus, suggesting that nitrification is substrate-limited. Fertilization with nitrogen and phosphorus resulted in significantly increased girth increments in Guapira fragrans (Dum. -Cours.) Little and Rapanea guianensis Aublet. Myrcianthes fragrans (Sw.) D.C. did not respond to the fertilization. The results of this study support the hypothesis that the characteristics of montane rain forest in small and large tropical mountains (the 'Massenerhebung' effect) are greatly controlled by soil water conditions and related soil nitrogen availability.},

abstract = {1. Tropical forests account for one-third of the total metabolic activity of the Earth's land surface. Hence, understanding the controls on tropical forest photosynthesis and respiration, and the allocation of the products of photosynthesis to canopy, woody tissue and rhizosphere, is important to understand global ecosystem functioning. 2. I review how studies in tropical ecosystem ecology have progressed since their inception in the 1960s towards developing a quantitative, mechanistic and global description of the carbon cycle of tropical vegetation. 3. I present a synthesis of studies in tropical forest sites in the Americas and Asia for which gross primary productivity (GPP) has been reported, and a subset of these sites for which net primary productivity (NPP) and ecosystem carbon use efficiency (CUE) have been estimated. GPP ranges between 30 and 40 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in lowland moist tropical forests and declines with elevation. CUE in tropical forests is at the low end of the global range reported for forests. 4. A pathway and framework are presented to explain the link between photosynthesis and tropical forest biomass, and to explain differences in carbon cycling and biomass between forests. Variation in CUE and allocation of NPP can be as important as variation in GPP in explaining differences in tropical forest growth rates between sites. 5. Finally, I explore some of the key questions surrounding the functioning and future of tropical forests in the rapidly changing conditions of the early Anthropocene. 6. Synthesis.There have been significant recent advances in quantifying the carbon cycle of tropical forests, but our understanding of causes of variation amongst forests is still poor. Moreover, we should expect all tropical forests in the 21st century, whether intact or disturbed, to be undergoing rapid change in function and composition; the key challenge for tropical ecosystem ecologists is to determine and understand the major and most fundamental aspects of this change.},

abstract = {Key Message: Tropical forests play a disproportionately large role in the global climate system, yet the extent to which nutrients limit the potential for tropical trees to increase carbon gain as atmospheric carbon dioxide rises is unknown.Abstract: This review focuses on what is known about tropical tree responses to experimental nutrient addition and how such information is critical for developing a more complete picture of the ability of tropical forest to respond to a changing world. Most of our knowledge of nutrient limitation of eco-physiological processes in tropical trees is derived from stand-scale nutrient addition experiments, in which physiological or growth responses signify limitation by that element. Our knowledge is further supplemented by fertilization studies of individual plants in pots. There is emerging evidence that fine root biomass decreases and maximum photosynthetic rates, water transport capacity and plant growth in tropical trees increase with nutrient addition, but the magnitude of response depends upon the successional status of the species, the size of the individual, light availability and the element in question.

abstract = {Resource managers and scientists from disparate disciplines are rising to the challenge of understanding and moderating human impacts on marine ecosystems. Traditional barriers to communication between marine ecologists, fisheries biologists, social scientists and economists are beginning to break down, and the distinction between applied and basic research is fading. These ongoing trends arise, in part, from an increasing awareness of the profound influence of people on the functioning of all marine ecosystems, an increased focus on spatial and temporal scale, and a renewed assessment of the role of biodiversity in the sustainability of ecosystem goods and services upon which human societies depend. Here, we highlight the emergence of a complex systems approach for sustaining and repairing marine ecosystems, linking ecological resilience to governance structures, economics and society. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {1. From previously published measurements of soil respiration rate (R) and temperature (T) the goodness of fit of various R vs T relationships was evaluated. 2. Exponential (Q10) and conventional Arrhenius relationships between T and R cannot provide an unbiased estimate of respiration rate. Nor is a simple linear relationship appropriate. 3. The relationship between R and T can, however, be accurately represented by an Arrhenius type equation where the effective activation energy for respiration varies inversely with temperature. An empirical equation is presented which yields an unbiased estimator of respiration rates over a wide range of temperatures. 4. When combined with seasonal estimates of Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) the empirical relationship derived provides representative estimates of the seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity and its effects on atmospheric CO2. The predicted seasonal cycle of net ecosystem productivity is very sensitive to the assumed respiration vs temperature relationship. 5. For biomes in areas where soil temperatures are low, soil respiration rate is relatively more sensitive to fluctuations in temperature. Nevertheless, more information is required before any predictions can be made about changes in soil carbon pools in response to future temperature changes.},

abstract = {Photosynthesis/nutrient relationships of proximally growing forest and savanna trees were determined in an ecotonal region of Cameroon (Africa). Although area-based foliar N concentrations were typically lower for savanna trees, there was no difference in photosynthetic rates between the two vegetation formation types. Opposite to N, area-based P concentrations were-on average-slightly lower for forest trees; a dependency of photosynthetic characteristics on foliar P was only evident for savanna trees. Thus savanna trees use N more efficiently than their forest counterparts, but only in the presence of relatively high foliar P. Along with some other recent studies, these results suggest that both N and P are important modulators of woody tropical plant photosynthetic capacities, influencing photosynthetic metabolism in different ways that are also biome specific. Attempts to find simple unifying equations to describe woody tropical vegetation photosynthesis-nutrient relationships are likely to meet with failure, with ecophysiological distinctions between forest and savanna requiring acknowledgement.},

abstract = {1 Plant growth forms are widely used to predict the effects of environmental changes, such as climate warming and increased nitrogen deposition, on plant communities, and the consequences of species shifts for carbon and nutrient cycling. We investigated whether the relationship between growth forms and patterns in litter quality and decom- position are independent of environmental conditions and whether growth forms are as good as litter chemistry at predicting decomposability. 2 We used a natural, latitudinal gradient in NW Europe as a spatial analogue for future increases in temperature and nitrogen availability. Our screening of 70 species typical of Sphagnum-dominated peatlands showed that leaf litters of Sphagnum mosses, evergreen and deciduous shrubs, graminoids and forbs differed significantly in litter chemistry and that the ranking of the growth forms was independent of the region for all litter chemistry variables. Differences among growth forms were usually larger than differences related to the environmental gradient. 3 After 8 and 20 months incubation in outdoor, Sphagnum-based decomposition beds, growth forms generally differed in decomposability, but these patterns varied with latitude. Sphagnum litters decomposed slower than other litters in all regions, again explaining its high representation in organic deposits of peatlands. Forb litters generally decomposed fastest, while the differences among the other growth forms were small, particularly at higher latitudes. 4 Multiple regression analyses showed that growth forms were better at predicting leaf litter decomposition than chemical variables in warm-temperate peatlands with a high N-load, but less so in the subarctic, low-N region. 5 Our results indicate that environmental changes may be less important in determining ecosystem leaf litter chemistry directly than are their indirect effects through changes in the relative abundance of growth forms. However, climatic and nutritional constraints in high-latitude peatlands promote convergence towards nutrient-efficient plant traits, resulting in similar decomposition rates of vascular growth forms despite differences in litter chemistry. The usefulness of the growth-form concept in predicting plant community controls on ecosystem functioning is therefore somewhat limited.},

abstract = {In a recent (1998) publication of Science, data from a large number of forest inventory plots were used to estimate biomass trends in old-growth tropical forests. Although no evidence was found of net biomass change in mature Paleotropical forests, old growth of the humid Neotropics was inferred to have been a substantial biomass carbon sink in recent decades. Methodological artifacts affected this analysis, however. Many humid Neotropical plots were measured strictly at breast height, where tropical trees frequently have buttresses and other protruberances. Because biomass allometric equations are based on above-buttress tree diameters, and because bole irregularities show disproportionately rapid radial increments, estimates of biomass and biomass increase must be based on above-buttress measurements. In addition, some plots were on recent floodplains, where forests undergo biomass accretion during primary succession. The data set includes 25 sites from the humid lowland Neotropics that were measured above buttresses with standard techniques and that were not on recent floodplains. Mean estimated biomass change for these sites was 0.3 Mg(.)ha(-1.)-yr(-1), with a 95{\%} confidence interval including 0.0 (-0.3 to +0.9 Mg(.)ha(-1.)yr(-1)). While the Science study was a laudable attempt to address an important aspect of the global carbon budget, the underlying data do not indicate a significant biomass carbon sink in old-growth forests of the humid Neotropics.},

abstract = {Climate change is predicted to increase both drought frequency and duration, and when coupled with substantial warming, will establish a new hydroclimatological model for many regions. Large-scale, warm droughts have recently occurred in North America, Africa, Europe, Amazonia and Australia, resulting in major effects on terrestrial ecosystems, carbon balance and food security. Here we compare the functional response of above-ground net primary production to contrasting hydroclimatic periods in the late twentieth century (1975-1998), and drier, warmer conditions in the early twenty-first century (2000-2009) in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We find a common ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUE(e): above-ground net primary production/evapotranspiration) across biomes ranging from grassland to forest that indicates an intrinsic system sensitivity to water availability across rainfall regimes, regardless of hydroclimatic conditions. We found higher WUE(e) in drier years that increased significantly with drought to a maximum WUE(e) across all biomes; and a minimum native state in wetter years that was common across hydroclimatic periods. This indicates biome-scale resilience to the interannual variability associated with the early twenty-first century drought--that is, the capacity to tolerate low, annual precipitation and to respond to subsequent periods of favourable water balance. These findings provide a conceptual model of ecosystem properties at the decadal scale applicable to the widespread altered hydroclimatic conditions that are predicted for later this century. Understanding the hydroclimatic threshold that will break down ecosystem resilience and alter maximum WUE(e) may allow us to predict land-surface consequences as large regions become more arid, starting with water-limited, low-productivity grasslands.},

A process-based model, fitted to the data, enabled estimation of the carbon absorbed by the ecosystem over the year as 8.5 ± 2.0 moles per square meter per year. },

abstract = {Elaborate division of labour has contributed significantly to the ecological success of social insects. Division of labour is achieved either by behavioural task specialization or by morphological specialization of colony members. In physical caste systems, the diet and rearing environment of developing larvae is known to determine the phenotype of adult individuals, but recent studies have shown that genetic components also contribute to the determination of worker caste. One of the most extreme cases of worker caste differentiation occurs in the army ant genus Eciton, where queens mate with many males and colonies are therefore composed of numerous full-sister subfamilies. This high intracolonial genetic diversity, in combination with the extreme caste polymorphism, provides an excellent test system for studying the extent to which caste determination is genetically controlled. Here we show that genetic effects contribute significantly to worker caste fate in Eciton burchellii. We conclude that the combination of polyandry and genetic variation for caste determination may have facilitated the evolution of worker caste diversity in some lineages of social insects.},

abstract = {The neotropical Heliconius butterflies are famous examples of Mflllerian mimicry, due to the diverse array of shared, brightly colored wing patterns that advertise the butterflies' unpalatabilit. The parallel geographical vari- ation in these patterns within several widespread species has been invoked to support the controversial Pleistocene refugium hypothesis of tropical diversification. However, in no Helico- nius species have either evolutionary rates or relationships among geographical races been explicitly examined. I present a phylogenetic hypothesis based on mitochondrial DNA se- quences for 14 divergent races of Heliconius erato, which reveals that similar wing patterns have evolved rapidly and convergently within the species. There is a basal split between groups of races from east and west of the Andes, reflecting a vicariant separation at the base of the Pleistocene. Within each of these clades, sequence divergence is very low, and some haplotypes are shared between allopatric races with radically different wing patterns. The topology implies a simultaneous radiation of races in these two areas within the last 200,000 years. Ages for the clades are estimated by comparing sequence divergence to a plot of mitochondrial divergence in several arthropod taxa with independently dated divergence times. This plot is linear and suggests that mitochondrial DNA in arthropods evolves in a clocklike manner, at least initially, when sequence divergence is low.},

Direct studies on the effects of observed climate change on crop growth and yield could provide more accurate information for assessing the impact of climate change on crop production. We analyzed weather data at the International Rice Research Institute Farm from 1979 to 2003 to examine temperature trends and the relationship between rice yield and temperature by using data from irrigated field experiments conducted at the International Rice Research Institute Farm from 1992 to 2003. Here we report that annual mean maximum and minimum temperatures have increased by 0.35 degrees C and 1.13 degrees C, respectively, for the period 1979-2003 and a close linkage between rice grain yield and mean minimum temperature during the dry cropping season (January to April). Grain yield declined by 10{\%} for each 1 degrees C increase in growing-season minimum temperature in the dry season, whereas the effect of maximum temperature on crop yield was insignificant. This report provides a direct evidence of decreased rice yields from increased nighttime temperature associated with global warming.},

Thirty morphospecies of ants (Formicidae), belonging to fifteen genus and six subfamilies, as well as one Mutillidae (Vespoidea), were collected from three locations in the municipality of Malinaltepec. Some species of ants, such as Eciton sp., Pachycondyla obscuricornis Emery, Pachycondyla sp., Labidus praedator Smith, Pheidole punctatissima Mayr and Pheidole sp.) are recognized as predictors of rain. Other ants, such as Solenopsis geminata Fabricius, are used to treat rheumatism and indolence. The queens Atta spp. are used as food. Detritus from the nests of Atta spp. serve as organic fertilizer. The generic name for ants in Tlapanec is Aku{\'{a}}n. Of the twelve names for nineteen different morphospecies, ten are made up of a generic name, combined with a specific term that describes a quality recognizable for the Tlapanec. This term may refer to a use of the species or, in the case of four Azteca and Conomyrma morphospecies called Aku{\'{a}}n ndatsin, it may refer to their unpleasant smell. Atta workers are called Aku{\'{a}}n riero, however queens go by the name of A{\~{n}}{\'{a}}'. Other less important morphospecies are identified only by their generic names.},

abstract = {Soil surface CO(2) flux (R(S)) is overwhelmingly the product of respiration by roots (autotrophic respiration, R(A)) and soil organisms (heterotrophic respiration, R(H)). Many studies have attempted to partition R(S) into these two components, with highly variable results. This study analyzes published data encompassing 54 forest sites and shows that R(A) and R(H) are each strongly (R(2){\textgreater}0.8) correlated to annual R(S) across a wide range of forest ecosystems. Monte Carlo simulation showed that these correlations were significantly stronger than any correlation introduced as an artefact of measurement method. Biome type, measurement method, mean annual temperature, soil drainage, and leaf habit were not significant. For sites with available data, there was a significant (R(2)=0.56) correlation between total detritus input and R(H), while R(A) was unrelated to net primary production. We discuss why R(A) and R(H) might be related to each other on large scales, as both ultimately depend on forest carbon balance and photosynthate supply. Limited data suggest that these or similar relationships have broad applicability in other ecosystem types. Site-specific measurements are always more desirable than the application of inferred broad relationships, but belowground measurements are difficult and expensive, while measuring R(S) is straightforward and commonly done. Thus the relationships presented here provide a useful method that can help constrain estimates of terrestrial carbon budgets.},

abstract = {Nitrogen fixation, the biological conversion of di-nitrogen to plant-available ammonium, is the primary natural input of nitrogen to ecosystems(1), and influences plant growth and carbon exchange at local to global scales(2-6). The role of this process in tropical forests is of particular concern, as these ecosystems harbour abundant nitrogen-fixing organisms(1,4) and represent one third of terrestrial primary production(4,7,8). Here we show that the micronutrient molybdenum, a cofactor in the nitrogen-fixing enzyme nitrogenase, limits nitrogen fixation by free-living heterotrophic bacteria in soils of lowland Panamanian forests. We measured the fixation response to long-term nutrient manipulations in intact forests, and to short-term manipulations in soil microcosms. Nitrogen fixation increased sharply in treatments of molybdenum alone, in micronutrient treatments that included molybdenum by design and in treatments with commercial phosphorus fertilizer, in which molybdenum was a 'hidden' contaminant. Fixation did not respond to additions of phosphorus that were not contaminated by molybdenum. Our findings show that molybdenum alone can limit asymbiotic nitrogen fixation in tropical forests and raise new questions about the role of molybdenum and phosphorus in the tropical nitrogen cycle. We suggest that molybdenum limitation may be common in highly weathered acidic soils, and may constrain the ability of some forests to acquire new nitrogen in response to CO2 fertilization(9).},

abstract = {Soil heterotrophic respiration (RH) is usually modeled using simple temperature dependence equations where the temperature sensitivity of RHcould vary for different soils and climate conditions. The temperature sensitivity is expressed as a function of the base rate of heterotrophic respiration (RH − 0) and the respiration change rate over a 10 °C temperature shift (Q10). A methodology was developed to better quantify these two parameters, and was validated using seven contrasting year-site soil respiration datasets collected in wheat fields. The data were acquired using soil respiration chambers and eddy flux towers in three mid-latitude European sites and one North American site. The first step consisted in parameterizing and initializing a semi-mechanistic process-based model then validating the prediction performance using 2/3 of the datasets. The coefficient of determinations between the predictions and the observations of daily soil respiration (Rs) was 0.71 and was 0.73 for its heterotrophic component (RH). The second step consisted in using the daily semi-mechanistic model predictions of RHfor each growing season and site to calibrate a simple empirical model describing RHresponse to soil temperature and water content. It was shown with the contrasting years-sites that coherent results were only obtained when a common average Q10value was determined prior to fit the base rate of heterotrophic respiration coefficient. Using a common Q10value of 2.2 provided more stable RH − 0for each site over time. It reflected the strong relationship between the RH − 0and the slow decomposing C in the first 30-cm soil layer. The simple empirical model, which was validated using 1/3 of the data, explained between 42{\%} and 92{\%} of the variability of RHover the different sites.},

abstract = {Plant litter is an important determinant of seed germination and seedling establishment. Positive effects of litter have received considerable attention, but few studies have explicitly tested whether seed- lings are more facilitated by conspecific litter compared to heterospecific litter. In order to contrast conspecific and heterospecific facilitative effects on seedling establishment, we used Anthriscus sylvestris, Angelica sylvestris, Pimpinella sax{\'{i}}fraga and differ- ent combinations of their seeds and litter seedbeds as a model system. Although litter had a significant species- specific effect on seedling emergence, we found no evidence of strictly conspecific facilitation. Anthris- cus sylvestris displayed a positive response to all types of litter. In contrast, there was a clear negative effect of conspecific litter in Pimpinella sax{\'{i}}fraga. Activated carbon did not modify the negative effect, indicating that chemical compounds were not the cause. Our study suggests a high level of idiosyncrasy in response to litter at the species level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent studies show that galling Hymenoptera and Diptera are able to synthesize the plant hormone indole-3-acetic acid (auxin) from tryptophan and that plant response to insect-produced auxin is implicated in gall formation. We examined the leaf transcriptome of galled and ungalled leaves of individuals of the Hawaiian endemic plant Metrosideros polymorpha (Myrtaceae) subject to infestation by psyllid (Hemiptera) gall-makers in the genus Trioza (Triozidae). RESULTS: Transcript libraries were sequenced using Illumina technology and the reads assembled de novo into contigs. Functional identification of contigs followed a two-step procedure, first identifying contigs by comparison to the completely sequenced genome of the related Eucalyptus, followed by identifying the equivalent Arabidopsis gene using a pre-computed mapping between Eucalyptus and Arabidopsis genes. This allowed us to use the rich functional annotation of the Arabidopsis genome to assess the transcriptional landscape of galling in Metrosideros. Comparing galled and ungalled leaves, we find a highly significant enrichment of expressed genes with a gene ontology (GO) annotation to auxin response in the former. One gene consistently expressed in all galled trees examined but not detected in any libraries from ungalled leaves was the Metrosideros version of SMALL AUXIN UPREGULATED (SAUR) 67 which appears to be a marker for leaf-galling in Metrosideros. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that an auxin response is involved in galling by Metrosideros psyllids. The possibility should therefore be considered that psyllids (like other insects examined) are able to synthesize auxin.},

abstract = {The high uncertainty in land-based CO2 fluxes estimates is thought to be mainly due to uncertainty in not only quantifying historical changes among forests, croplands, and grassland, but also due to different processes included in calculation methods. Inclusion of a nitrogen (N) cycle in models is fairly recent and strongly affects carbon (C) fluxes. In this study, for the first time, we use a model with C and N dynamics with three distinct historical reconstructions of land-use and land-use change (LULUC) to quantify LULUC emissions and uncertainty that includes the integrated effects of not only climate and CO2 but also N. The modeled global average emissions including N dynamics for the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000-2005 were 1.8 ± 0.2, 1.7 ± 0.2, and 1.4 ± 0.2 GtC yr(-1) , respectively, (mean and range across LULUC data sets). The emissions from tropics were 0.8 ± 0.2, 0.8 ± 0.2, and 0.7 ± 0.3 GtC yr(-1) , and the non tropics were 1.1 ± 0.5, 0.9 ± 0.2, and 0.7 ± 0.1 GtC yr(-1) . Compared to previous studies that did not include N dynamics, modeled net LULUC emissions were higher, particularly in the non tropics. In the model, N limitation reduces regrowth rates of vegetation in temperate areas resulting in higher net emissions. Our results indicate that exclusion of N dynamics leads to an underestimation of LULUC emissions by around 70{\%} in the non tropics, 10{\%} in the tropics, and 40{\%} globally in the 1990s. The differences due to inclusion/exclusion of the N cycle of 0.1 GtC yr(-1) in the tropics, 0.6 GtC yr(-1) in the non tropics, and 0.7 GtC yr(-1) globally (mean across land-cover data sets) in the 1990s were greater than differences due to the land-cover data in the non tropics and globally (0.2 GtC yr(-1) ). While land-cover information is improving with satellite and inventory data, this study indicates the importance of accounting for different processes, in particular the N cycle.},

abstract = {Although there is a widespread belief that phosphorus (P) limits basic ecosystem processes in moist tropical forests, direct tests of this supposition are rare. At the same time, it is generally believed that P does not limit soil microorganism respiration or growth in terrestrial ecosystems. We used natural gradients in P fertility created by soils of varying age underlying tropical rain forests in southwestern Costa Rica, combined with direct manipulations of carbon (C) and P supply, to test the effects of P availability on the decomposition of multiple forms of C, including dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Results from a combination of laboratory and field experiments suggest that C decomposition in old, highly weathered oxisol soils is strongly constrained by P availability. In addition, P additions to these soils (no C added) also revealed that microbial utilization of at least labile fractions of SOC was also P limited. To our knowledge, this is the first direct evidence of P limitation of microbial processes in tropical rain forest soil. We suggest that P limitation of microbial decomposition may have profound implications for C cycling in moist tropical forests, including their potential response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Furthermore, this site is still relatively rich in P when compared to many other tropical forests on old soils; thus, we believe that P limitation of soil microorganisms throughout the humid tropics is a possibility.},

abstract = {This study evaluates the effects of chemical fertilization on litter production, litter arthropods, and earthworms in tropical wet and cloud forests in the Luquillo Mountains in northeastern Puerto Rico. Litter production, chemistry and turnover, forest floor mass, litter arthropod density (individuals g-1 dry litter), abundance (individuals m-2) and diversity, and earthworm abundance and fresh mass (g m-2) were measured in 20 m × 20 m control and fertilized plots. We hypothesized that fertilization would increase litter arthropod density, abundance and diversity in both forests through elevating litter production and improving litter quality, and the increased litter quality in fertilized plots was also expected to result in faster litter turnover rates. Fertilization significantly increased monthly litterfall production and litter quality as measured by leaf litter C/N and C/P ratios in both forests, and higher litter production led to significant litter accumulation on the forest floor. Litter arthropod abundance increased in the wet forest fertilized plots due to the accumulated litter. Higher litter quality did not affect litter arthropod density in either forest, and densities were slightly higher in the cloud forest. High litter quality increased litter turnover rate in the cloud forest only. A significant reduction in earthworm populations in fertilized plots may have offset the positive effect of litter quality on litter turnover in the wet forest. Shannon biodiversity index for litter arthropod taxa was similar between treatments in the wet forest, and was higher in the wet forest than cloud forest. We conclude that climate influences litter arthropod diversity, but differences in litter quantity and quality do not affect their densities in island tropical wet and cloud forests. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Sw., Hemionitis arifolia (H. arifolia) (Burm. f.) T. Moore, Actinopteris radiate (A. radiata) (J. Koenig ex Sw.) Link and Adiantum latifolium (A. latifolium) Lam. Methods: The shade dried and powdered fronds (50 g) were extracted successively with 250 mL of petroleum ether, benzene, chloroform, methanol and distilled water using a Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature of 50-60曟 (not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent). Phytochemical analysis of the extracts was carried out according to the standard procedures. Results: Among the twenty five tested extracts, twenty extracts showed the presence of flavonoids. Phenolic compounds are present in methanol extracts of all the ferns. Five extracts showed the presence of triterpinoids and catechins. Ten extracts showed the occurrence of sugars and reducing sugars. Fifteen extracts showed the presence of alkaloids. Tannins and saponins are present in eight extracts. Steroids occurred in all the twenty five extracts. Only three extracts showed the presence of anthroquinones and amino acids. Conclusions: From this investigation, it can be concluded that the selected five medicinal ferns contain more bioactive principles. These potential ferns could be used as bio control agnets.},

abstract = {There is considerable interest in the potential use of soils to sequester carbon for climate change mitigation. As such, there is a need to evaluate the potential for carbon accumulation in tropical regions. We compared the effects of three annual additions of nitrogen and/or phosphorus on soil carbon and nitrogen contents and pools (bulk soil, macro-, meso-, and microaggregates) of two regenerating secondary tropical dry forest differing in nutrient status and succession stage (10-year-old early-succession stage and approximately 60-year-old late-succession stage). The selected forest sites were located on a shallow calcareous soil in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico). The primary production is limited by nitrogen and phosphorus in early-succession stage and by phosphorus in late-succession stage. In each forest site, four independent plots (12 x 12 m2) were established, the treatments being: controls and plots fertilized during three consecutive years with nitrogen, phosphorus, or nitrogen plus phosphorus. In both forests, soil carbon and nitrogen contents were consistently high, with soil carbon:nitrogen ratios generally greater than 10. Results indicate that usually there are no significant increases of soil carbon stock associated to late succession but can be increased to 3.7 Mg center dot ha-1 center dot yr-1 with adoption of fertilizer practices. The potential soil carbon sequestration in early-succession forest was estimated to be 2.7 Mg center dot ha-1 center dot yr-1, and there is no indication that fertilization improves carbon sequestration. In short, results suggest that the soil potential for carbon sequestration in these ecosystems is high and depends on the specific nutrient status of the site.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Springer Science+Business Media B.V. The gall-inducing fly family Fergusoninidae, in association with a mutualist nematode, induces galls on Myrtaceae. Each fly species typically targets a particular site on its host plant, giving rise to a range of gall types, and one plant species may host at least four fly species. While incongruent fly–host evolutionary time scales preclude early cospeciation, it is possible that Fergusoninidae have been diverging with their host plants more recently at correspondingly finer taxonomic levels, such as within host subgenera. To test this possibility, we reduced the scale of our analysis and focussed on a clade of ten Eucalyptus species, sampling intensively and using a phylogenetic approach to compare the relationships between these plant hosts and their associated flies. We also took advantage of the fact that three different gall types, each with its own clade of Fergusonina flies, could be sampled on this focal host clade, in effect giving us three different host/fly association tests on the one set of hosts. The phylogenies of flies from the three different gall types were estimated using Bayesian analysis of mtCOI sequences and compared with an existing phylogeny of the eucalypt host clade. While each gall type showed a different pattern of host relationships, heuristic and quantitative analyses showed that there was little correspondence between plant and fly phylogenies and we conclude that host switching is prevalent in this system. There was more host fidelity in the flower bud gallers on this group of eucalypts, and there was least in the leaf blade gallers, with the shoot bud gallers demonstrating an intermediate level of host fidelity. We discuss the possible factors which may have led to their patterns of host association. This is the first study of Fergusonina to focus on one clade of Eucalyptus L'H{\'{e}}rit. (Myrtaceae) with intensive sampling and shows that each host plant species is commonly used by multiple fergusoninid species. This has provided us with the opportunity to study in detail the host relationships of three separate clades of Fergusonina from different plant tissue types, and has revealed many previously unrecorded host plant/gall site associations.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A sound ethnopharmacological survey was performed during the years 2011, 2012 and 2013 in different places along Callej{\'{o}}n de Huaylas valley in the peruvian Andes, were Quechua speaking communities dwell. Two different methodologies were used: first, plant uses were recorded during walks with informants and in medicinal plant markets held on a regular bases in the area (Huaraz, Carhuaz, Yungay). Secondly, traditional healers (curanderas, curanderos) were interviewed about their practices and healing sessions were observed, in order to understand better the traditional medicinal system as a whole (disease aetiology, diagnosis, treatments, healers). RESULTS: Altogether, 178 medicinal species were collected. Most of the plants found on the market were also found in the wild and vice-versa. Medicinal plant trade is exclusively held by women, selling their merchandise to local people or to big retailer. Plants are classified according their hot or cold virtues, this in accordance with the local conception of the body physiology and disease aetiology, based on a hot-cold polarity. Main use notified for medicinal plants is "(bath) against cold", a prophylactic measure against diseases of cold nature. Other uses include culture bound illnesses i.e. susto, aire, nervios, or heart pain, commonly cited in South America. Regarding symptoms, rheumatic/arthritic pain, musculoskeletal traumas, cough, pulmonary and respiratory problems, gastritis and stomach ache, were the most frequently cited. Diagnosis and treatment are intrinsically linked together and mainly based upon divination techniques using egg and cuy (Cavia porcellus L., Caviidae). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Medicinal plants use and traditional medicinal practices are still very vivid in Callej{\'{o}}n de Huaylas as highlighted by the abundance of medicinal plants traded in the markets. In this business, women have a key position as healers at the family and community level. Medicinal uses of the majority of the species presented here are reported for the first time. Because medicinal plants sold on the market are collected from the wild and also because high altitude medicinal plants are generally small herbaceous species pulled out with their roots, there is a serious risk of over exploitation and extinction of endemic species.},

abstract = {Paradoxically, symbiotic dinitrogen (N2 ) fixers are abundant in nitrogen (N)-rich, phosphorus (P)-poor lowland tropical rain forests. One hypothesis to explain this pattern states that N2 fixers have an advantage in acquiring soil P by producing more N-rich enzymes (phosphatases) that mineralise organic P than non-N2 fixers. We assessed soil and root phosphatase activity between fixers and non-fixers in two lowland tropical rain forest sites, but also addressed the hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonisation (another P acquisition strategy) is greater on fixers than non-fixers. Root phosphatase activity and AM colonisation were higher for fixers than non-fixers, and strong correlations between AM colonisation and N2 fixation at both sites suggest that the N-P interactions mediated by fixers may generally apply across tropical forests. We suggest that phosphatase enzymes and AM fungi enhance the capacity of N2 fixers to acquire soil P, thus contributing to their high abundance in tropical forests.},

abstract = {We conducted monthly measurements of extractable soil nutrients, including N, P, base cations, and micronutrients, as well as the potential toxin Al, in a long-term fertilization experiment in lowland tropical rain forest in the Republic of Panama. Our prediction was that the response of individual nutrients to seasonal climate and fertilizer addition would vary depending on the nature of their biogeochemical cycles. We detected significant seasonal variation in soil pH and all nutrients measured, although only extractable K concentrations were greater in the early wet season, while extractable phosphate varied little in plots that did not receive P addition. A decade of N addition increased soil nitrate, had no effect on extractable ammonium, and decreased soil pH (∼0.8 units in plots receiving only N). The decline in pH caused a corresponding decline in extractable base cations (Ca and K) and increased extractable Al, highlighting an important but poorly understood consequence of long-term atmospheric N deposition onto tropical forests. A decade of P addition increased extractable phosphate by 50-fold, indicating that chronic fertilizer addition has overcome the high phosphate sorption capacity of the soil. Potassium addition without N increased extractable soil K by 91{\%}, but only by 25{\%} when K was added in combination with N, suggesting that the previously reported N × K interactive effect on trunk growth rates could be a true response to N addition. Extractable Cu and Zn were increased twofold by micronutrient fertilizer addition, were reduced in the dry season, but were not affected by N addition (i.e., soil acidification). We conclude that the response of extractable nutrients to seasonal climate and fertilizer addition varies among nutrients, and suggest that greater attention be paid to the biological implications of acidification in response to long-term atmospheric N deposition onto strongly-weathered tropical forest soils. {\textcopyright} Soil Science Society of America.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: In the Hong Kong rocky intertidal, the demography of the acorn barnacle Tetraclita japonica is largely determined by regular, intense mortality events in the summer and subsequent pulses of recruitment in late summer. During 2 consecutive summers from 2000 to 2001, 34 to 52 and 98 to 99{\%} of T. japonica were killed on the mid- and high shore, respectively, with younger cohorts suffering higher mortality in the mid-shore. Recruitment of T. japonica occurs in late summer; as a result, the population in the high shore consists of a single cohort of new recruits, while the mid-shore supports 2 cohorts (new recruits and adult survivors). To investigate how thermal stress affects acorn barnacle populations, air and rock temperatures and sub-lethal physiological measures (body tem- perature, sinus pulsation rate and haemolymph osmolality) of T. japonica were taken on the mid- and high shore during daytime, low spring tides in June–July 2001. Mean body temperature increased gradually after emersion, reaching a maximum of {\~{}}48°C at noon, 6 to 8°C higher than the adjacent rock surface. T. japonica entered a heat-induced coma when body temperatures reached 45°C. Osmolality of the haemolymph and sinus pulsation rate increased with body temperature as a result of water loss and possibly altered haemolymph pressure; both were greater in high than in mid-shore individuals, with barnacles on horizontal surfaces being hotter than those on vertical surfaces. Body temperature and sinus pulsation rate differed between shore levels, but were similar at spatial scales of 1 to 20 m at the same tidal height. Haemolymph osmolality, however, varied over this distance, probably due to individual variation in the amount of mantle water trapped before emersion and pos- sible micro-habitat differences. Heat and desiccation stress, therefore, play an important role in determining the life history of T. japonica by limiting their distribution and abundance and influenc- ing the demography of the population at different spatial scales.},

abstract = {Soils can be sources or sinks of carbon depending on the balance between carbon inputs from plants and losses from the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). A good understanding of the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition is critical for forecasting whether soils in a warming world will lose or gain carbon, and therefore accelerate or mitigate the rate of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. We provide new evidence to show that the response of SOM decomposition to temperature may be constrained by substrate availability to microbial decomposers. We used laboratory incubations of a grassland soil to compare the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition with unmodified substrate availability with that of the same soil in which substrate availability was reduced by adding allophane, a clay-size mineral with a high capacity for binding SOM. In the soil with no added allophane, the decomposition rate increased about 7-fold over the temperature range from 1 to 40 °C. With added allophane, decomposition rate increased only about 3-fold over the same temperature range. We then used a non-disruptive, natural abundance isotopic technique at our field site to partition total soil respiration into CO2efflux from newly released,13C-depleted SOM (root respiration and rhizosphere decomposition) from CO2efflux from older13C-enriched SOM from the decomposition of more stable SOM. We found no increase in the decomposition rate of the13C-enriched pool of SOM between 11 and 28 °C. That finding contrasts with most previous studies that have generally reported strong increases in SOM decomposition with temperature. We hypothesised that the large temperature sensitivity observed in laboratory incubations was due to substrate becoming readily available as a result of the disturbance involved in collecting soil samples. In undisturbed field conditions, the limiting step for the decomposition of the more stable SOM pool may be the rate at which decomposable substrate becomes available for decomposition. Our findings will have important implications for the feedbacks between soil carbon storage and the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2concentration mediated by global warming.},

abstract = {Abstract The ability to predict C cycle responses to temperature changes depends on the accurate representation of temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition in C models for different C pools and soil depths. Theoretically, Q10 of SOM decomposition is determined by SOM quality and availability (referred to here as SOM protection). Here, we focus on the role of SOM protection in attenuating the intrinsic, SOM quality dependent Q10. To assess the separate effects of SOM quality and protection, we incubated topsoil and subsoil samples characterized by differences in SOM protection under optimum moisture conditions at 25 °C and 35 °C. Although lower SOM quality in the subsoil should lead to a higher Q10 according to kinetic theory, we observed a much lower overall temperature response in subsoil compared with the topsoil. Q10 values determined for respired SOM fractions of decreasing lability within the topsoil increased from 1.9 for the most labile to 3.8 for the least labile respired SOM, whereas corresponding Q10 values for the subsoil did not show this trend (Q10 between 1.4 and 0.9). These results indicate the existence of a limiting factor that attenuates the intrinsic effect of SOM quality on Q10 in the subsoil. A parallel incubation experiment of 13C-labeled plant material added to top- and subsoil showed that decomposition of an unprotected C substrate of equal quality responds similarly to temperature changes in top- and subsoil. This further confirms that the attenuating effect on Q10 in the subsoil originates from SOM protection rather than from microbial properties or other nutrient limitations. In conclusion, we found experimental evidence that SOM protection can attenuate the intrinsic Q10 of SOM decomposition.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

Survivorship is initially very poor, apparently due to desiccation stress, but improves substantially after four months. An examination of the intertidal positions and life histories of Tetraclita and Chthamalus congeners from different coastlines of the world reveals a relative con- servatism of life histories, regardless of position in the intertidal.

I performed two experiments in an early-successional site in two consecutive years. In the first experiment I tested the effects of litter and competition, and their interaction, on establishment and growth of tree seedlings. In the second experiment I studied the effect of insecticide application in combination with litter and herb competition on seedling establishment and growth, and on arthropod abundance. In the absence of competition, litter had no significant effect on the biomass of woody seedlings, though it delayed seedling emergence. Herb competition reduced the growth of the woody seedlings, but the addition of leaf litter reduced the density and biomass of the herbs, indirectly improving the growth of the woody seedlings. Litter increased both invertebrate damage to seedling cotyledons and seedling mortality. The application of insecticide increased seedling emergence and reduced seedling mortality, and more so in the presence of litter. The total number of arthropods and the number of plant-chewing arthropods were increased by the addition of litter and reduced by application of insecticide. Thus, litter had, simultaneously, a positive indirect effect on individual biomass through reduced competition, and a negative indirect effect on the number of individuals through increased seed and/or seedling predation, and a negative direct effect on seedling mortality.},

abstract = {Periodic changes in temperature commonly occur diurnally and seasonally. However, the response of soil heterotrophic respiration to rising and decreasing temperatures during these periods remains poorly understood; thus the feedback between climate change and carbon (C) cycling requires further investigation. In this study, soils from three grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were incubated separately at rising (from 5 °C to 31 °C) and decreasing (from 31 °C to 5 °C) temperatures modes over 161 days, to explore how soil heterotrophic respiration rates (RS) respond to different temperature changes. The parameters of RSand temperature sensitivity (Q10) were used for the analyses. In addition, microbial biomass C (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (N) (MBN), dissolved organic C (DOC), and other soil properties were measured. The results indicated a pronounced hysteresis of RSfor both rising and decreasing temperatures. Furthermore, the hysteresis loops differed in the different sites. RSvalues were significantly higher for rising temperature (2.71 $\mu$g C g−1d−1) versus decreasing temperature (1.75 $\mu$g C g−1d−1) in all three alpine grasslands. The Q10values were significantly higher for decreasing temperature (2.42) versus increasing temperature (1.55), with these differences being observed over the 161-d incubation period. Furthermore, soil microbes (specifically, MBC and MBC/MBN) explained 46–77{\%} of the total variation in Q10, followed by substrate and other properties. Our results provide experimental evidence for the asymmetric responses of soil heterotrophic respiration to rising and decreasing temperatures. In addition, the microbial effect was primarily associated with soil heterotrophic respiration, suggesting strong asymmetric responses to rising and decreasing temperatures that require investigation in future studies.},

abstract = {Developing countries are required to produce robust estimates of forest carbon stocks for successful implementation of climate change mitigation policies related to reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD). Here we present a "benchmark" map of biomass carbon stocks over 2.5 billion ha of forests on three continents, encompassing all tropical forests, for the early 2000s, which will be invaluable for REDD assessments at both project and national scales. We mapped the total carbon stock in live biomass (above- and belowground), using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots and satellite light detection and ranging (Lidar) samples of forest structure to estimate carbon storage, plus optical and microwave imagery (1-km resolution) to extrapolate over the landscape. The total biomass carbon stock of forests in the study region is estimated to be 247 Gt C, with 193 Gt C stored aboveground and 54 Gt C stored belowground in roots. Forests in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia accounted for 49{\%}, 25{\%}, and 26{\%} of the total stock, respectively. By analyzing the errors propagated through the estimation process, uncertainty at the pixel level (100 ha) ranged from ± 6{\%} to ± 53{\%}, but was constrained at the typical project (10,000 ha) and national ({\textgreater}1,000,000 ha) scales at ca. ± 5{\%} and ca. ± 1{\%}, respectively. The benchmark map illustrates regional patterns and provides methodologically comparable estimates of carbon stocks for 75 developing countries where previous assessments were either poor or incomplete.},

abstract = {Insect larvae metamorphose to winged and reproductive adults either directly (hemimetaboly) or through an intermediary pupal stage (holometaboly). In either case juvenile hormone (JH) prevents metamorphosis until a larva has attained an appropriate phase of development. In holometabolous insects, JH acts through its putative receptor Methoprene-tolerant (Met) to regulate Kr{\"{u}}ppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h1) and Broad-Complex (BR-C) genes. While Met and Kr-h1 prevent precocious metamorphosis in pre-final larval instars, BR-C specifies the pupal stage. How JH signaling operates in hemimetabolous insects is poorly understood. Here, we compare the function of Met, Kr-h1 and BR-C genes in the two types of insects. Using systemic RNAi in the hemimetabolous true bug, Pyrrhocoris apterus, we show that Met conveys the JH signal to prevent premature metamorphosis by maintaining high expression of Kr-h1. Knockdown of either Met or Kr-h1 (but not of BR-C) in penultimate-instar Pyrrhocoris larvae causes precocious development of adult color pattern, wings and genitalia. A natural fall of Kr-h1 expression in the last larval instar normally permits adult development, and treatment with an exogenous JH mimic methoprene at this time requires both Met and Kr-h1 to block the adult program and induce an extra larval instar. Met and Kr-h1 therefore serve as JH-dependent repressors of deleterious precocious metamorphic changes in both hemimetabolous and holometabolous juveniles, whereas BR-C has been recruited for a new role in specifying the holometabolous pupa. These results show that despite considerable evolutionary distance, insects with diverse developmental strategies employ a common-core JH signaling pathway to commit to adult morphogenesis.},

abstract = {The response of soil CO2fluxes (Rsoil) to interactions between carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) availability or C and temperature conditions is not well understood, but may increasingly affect future C storage under the combined anthropogenic impacts of N deposition and climate change. Here we addressed this uncertainty through a series of laboratory incubation experiments using soils from three contrasting ecosystems to investigate how changes in C, N, and temperature regulate Rsoilthrough changes to Michaelis-Menten parameters (i.e. Vmaxand Km). Results of this study demonstrate that Rsoilresponse to N enrichment and changes in temperature are dependent on the C availability of soil substrates. N addition influenced Rsoilthrough both the maximum rate (Vmax) and the half saturation constant (Km). The increase in Kmcorresponded to a decrease in Rsoilwhen C was limited. Alternatively, when C was abundant, N enrichment increased Rsoil, which corresponded to an increase in Vmax. Regulation of temperature sensitivity through Vmaxand Kmwas also dependent on C availability. Both Vmaxand Kmdemonstrated positive temperature responses, supporting the hypothesis of a canceling effect at low C concentrations. While temperature sensitivity was influenced by both C quantity and C complexity, our results suggested that C quantity is a stronger predictor. Despite strong differences in climate, vegetation, and management of our soils, C-N and C-temperature interactions were markedly similar between sites, highlighting the importance of C availability in the regulation of Rsoiland justifying the use of Michaelis-Menten kinetics in biogeochemical modeling.},

abstract = {Quantifying nutrient limitation of primary productivity is a fundamental task of terrestrial ecosystem ecology, but in a high carbon dioxide environment it is even more critical that we understand potential nutrient constraints on plant growth. Ecologists often manipulate nutrients with fertilizer to assess nutrient limitation, yet for a variety of reasons, nutrient fertilization experiments are either impractical or incapable of resolving ecosystem responses to some global changes. The challenges of conducting large, in situ fertilization experiments are magnified in forests, especially the high-diversity forests common throughout the lowland tropics. A number of methods, including fertilization experiments, could be seen as tools in a toolbox that ecologists may use to attempt to assess nutrient limitation, but there has been no compilation or synthetic discussion of those methods in the literature. Here, we group these methods into one of three categories (indicators of soil nutrient supply, organismal indicators of nutrient limitation, and lab-based experiments and nutrient depletions), and discuss some of the strengths and limitations of each. Next, using a case study, we compare nutrient limitation assessed using these methods to results obtained using large-scale fertilizations across the Hawaiian Archipelago. We then explore the application of these methods in high-diversity tropical forests. In the end, we suggest that, although no single method is likely to predict nutrient limitation in all ecosystems and at all scales, by simultaneously utilizing a number of the methods we describe, investigators may begin to understand nutrient limitation in complex and diverse ecosystems such as tropical forests. In combination, these methods represent our best hope for understanding nutrient constraints on the global carbon cycle, especially in tropical forest ecosystems.},

A multivariate model for measuring stability and resilience based on Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is outlined. The criteria for the model to work are explained and the model is tested on vegetation and soil data from the Dorset Heaths. The model provides a mechanism for bringing together measurements of both structure (species composition) and function (ecosystem properties, both biotic and abiotic), to measure stability and resilience of ecosystems. The model can also be used to measure the success of management in restoring communities and to provide information to conservation policy makers and land managers.},

Mass loss of leaf litter in litter bags was determined on three occasions, in two experiments, during a 12-month period. Paired root-exclusion plots were located randomly within a D. corymbosa forest. Both D. corymbosa and mixed-species leaf litters were reciprocally transplanted into their respective forest types. Elemental analysis was performed on the residual D. corymbosa leaf litter after 1 yr. Leaf litter mass loss in the D. corymbosa forest was not influenced by EM, despite high EM colonization. Elemental analysis of D. corymbosa leaf litter residues demonstrated reduced calcium levels in the presence of EM, which were negatively correlated with EM rootlet-colonizing mass. The lack of EM effect on the litter decomposition rate, coupled with high EM colonization, suggests an important but indirect role in mineral nutrient acquisition. Lowered Ca concentration in leaf litter exposed to EM may suggest a high Ca demand by the ectotroph system.},

abstract = {Even small changes in microbial decomposition rates of soil organic carbon (SOC) at the regional scale have the potential to modify land-atmospheric feedbacks at the global scale. Limited understanding of the regulation of microbial driven processes has led to major uncertainty in global SOC estimates. Therefore, to better understand the large scale processes controlling SOC dynamics, we examined the influence of SOC quantity, quality, and soil physical and biochemical properties on soil basal respiration and of the temperature sensitivities (Q10) of soil respiration and enzymes ($\beta$-glucosidase and xylanase) at two scales: landscape (two individual areas, each approximately 27 km2) and regional (pooled data of both areas). Soil samples (0–30 cm soil depth) originated from 41 agricultural sites distributed over two areas in southwest Germany differing in climatic and geological conditions. We used a two-step data analysis procedure; variable selection through random Forest regression, followed by shortlisting of significant explanatory variables using linear mixed-effect models. Microbial biomass regulated soil basal respiration at both scales, whereas soil C:N ratio played an important role only at the regional scale based on mixed-effect models. Soil texture significantly explained temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil respiration at both scales. Different SOC quality fractions characterized by midDRIFTS played a minor role, whereas extractable organic C related negatively to the respiration Q10. Soil properties controlling soil enzymes (Q10) were scale-specific. We found pH to be the main factor affecting $\beta$-glucosidase Q10at the landscape scale. We argue that scale-specificity of variables may depend on homogeneity of study areas and should be considered when exploring SOC dynamics. Our study identified direct and indirect controlling factors affecting soil basal respiration and its temperature sensitivity, providing vital information for SOC dynamics at large scales.},

abstract = {Quantification of temporal and spatial variation of soil CO2 emissions is essential for an accurate interpretation of tower-based measurements of net ecosystem exchange. Here, we measured in the old-growth forest of Caxiuana, Eastern Amazonia soil CO2 efflux and its environmental controls from two Oxisol sites with contrasting soil texture and at different landscape positions. Average CO2 efflux was 21{\%} higher for sand (3.93 ?? 0.06 ??mol CO2 m-2 s-1) than for the clay (3.08 ?? 0.07 ??mol CO2 m-2 s-1). No difference was detected for soil temperature between sites, while soil water content in sandy soil (23.2 ?? 0.33{\%}) was much lower than the clay soil (34.5 ?? 0.98{\%}), for the 2-year period. Soil CO2 efflux did not differ between dry and wet season, but we detected a significant interaction between season and topographic position. The variation caused by topography was in the same order of magnitude as temporal variation. Mean contribution of the litter layer to the CO2 efflux rates was 20{\%} and varied from 25{\%} during the wet season to close to 0{\%} during the dry season. The relation between soil water content and soil CO2 efflux showed an optimum for both soil textures but the shape and optimum of the curves were different. The results of our study illustrate that soil moisture is an important driver of temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux in this old-growth forest. When extrapolating soil CO2 efflux to larger areas, the significant influences of soil texture, litter, and the interaction of topographical position and time illustrate that it is necessary to include some of the complexity of landscapes. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract: On the central Pacific coast of Costa Rica, populations of Tetraclita panamemis (Pilsbry) were studied to determine the relative importance of pre- and postrecruitment processes in determining patterns of distribution and abundance. Populations at 12 sites on two shores were censused photographically from 1983 to 1985 at I-3-months intervals, yielding data on recruitment, growth, and mortality. During the 2.5-yr study, recruitment replaced {\textless} 24{\%} of the number dying at 10 of the 12 sites. Most populations were sparse and declining. Preemption of settlement was unlikely because bare space was always abundant and recruitment occurred mostly on the shells of adults. Individuals reached a maximum size in l-3 yr, after which there was little growth. Estimated longevity ranged from 3.6 to 14.7 yr among sites. Mortality was unrelated to submergence, density or the abundance of an important predator, the gastropod Acanthina brevidentata (Wood). Patterns of distribution and abundance among the 12 sites and along the central coast of Costa Rica are probably a function of past variation in recruitment. Many apparently suitable habitats are unoccupied.},

abstract = {The question of how tropical trees cope with infertile soils has been challenging to address, in part, because fine root dynamics must be studied in situ. We used annual fertilization with nitrogen (N as urea, 12.5gNm-2year-1), phosphorus (P as superphosphate, 5gPm-2year-1) and potassium (K as KCl, 5gKm-2year-1) within 38ha of old-growth lowland tropical moist forest in Panama and examined fine root dynamics with minirhizotron images. We expected that added P, above all, would (i) decrease fine root biomass but, (ii) have no impact on fine root turnover. Soil in the study area was moderately acidic (pH=5.28), had moderate concentrations of exchangeable base cations (13.4cmolkg-1), low concentrations of Bray-extractable phosphate (PO4=2.2mgkg-1), and modest concentrations of KCl-extractable nitrate (NO3=5.0mgkg-1) and KCl-extractable ammonium (NH4=15.5mgkg-1). Added N increased concentrations of KCl-extractable NO3 and acidified the soil by one pH unit. Added P increased concentrations of Bray-extractable PO4 and P in the labile fraction. Concentrations of exchangeable K were elevated in K addition plots but reduced by N additions. Fine root dynamics responded to added K rather than added P. After 2 years, added K decreased fine root biomass from 330 to 275gm-2. The turnover coefficient of fine roots {\textless}1mm diameter ranged from 2.6 to 4.4 per year, and the largest values occurred in plots with added K. This study supported the view that biomass and dynamics of fine roots respond to soil nutrient availability in species-rich, lowland tropical moist forest. However, K rather than P elicited root responses. Fine roots smaller than 1mm have a short lifetime ({\textless}140 days), and control of fine root production by nutrient availability in tropical forests deserves more study. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

Addition of +P reduced the leaf mass per area but increased the leaf area ratio and foliar P concentrations. However, it did not increase the biomass or total leaf area of D. lanceolata. Additions of +NPK and +NPKCa increased the biomass, total leaf area, foliar P and K concentrations but not foliar N concentration. Calcium additions had no effect on seedling growth, indicating that magnesium toxicity was not important.

(Melastomataceae) is a characteristic species of Serra do Mar, with potential for recovery of degraded areas and with landscaping purpose. The aim of this study was to investigate the acquisition of germination capacity of seeds and establishment of the best period for fruit harvest by weekly harvests, when morphological and germination capacity features were observed in four stages of development. The T. mutabilis seeds germinated only under white light. Besides the necessity of light for germination, seeds of T. mutabilis did not show another type of dormancy at the end of the ripening, with high germination percentage. The germination rate increases progressively in the function of lose of moisture in the subsequent stages of development, suggesting that the high moisture was the factor that restricted the germination. The best indicator of physiological maturation of seeds is the natural opening of the capsule. The advantage of this parameter is that it can be widely utilized and it is easy to recognize it. Due to the anemochoric dispersion of seeds, we propose that the harvest must be done, with good results, of fruit with 21 days after anthesis, and drying the fruit for capsule opening for seed extraction.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Castilleja tenuiflora Benth. is a hemiparasitic plant that is used for medicinal purposes. These hemiparasitic plants are characterized by haustoria – organs that develop on the roots of the parasite and function in host attachment, invasion, and uptake of nutrients and water from the host plant. The hosts of C. tenuiflora are unknown, and the characteristics of its haustoria have not been reported. We evaluated the plant density, size, phenological stage, number of haustoria, and potential hosts in a field population of C. tenuiflora. Cross-and longitudinal sections of haustoria were stained with safranin O and fast green, and the presence of starch and tannins was determined histochemically. The density of C. tenuiflora in the field population was 8 ± 3 plants/m 2 and there were plants at the vegetative, floral, and senescent stages. The number (1–6) and size (0.5–2.5 mm) of haustoria varied with plant size. In the field, individuals of C. tenuiflora were growing near plants belonging to families Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Pinaceae and Poaceae. The haustoria were globular, bore hairs, and consisted of dermal, ground, vascular, and young endophyte. Starch was stored in the ground tissue and condensed tannins were present in the young endophyte. The haustoria also contained sclerotic tissue (fibers and sclereids), alternate-pit-type vessel elements, and scalariform tracheids. Our findings provide new information on components of haustoria that might be related to the efficiency of water transport and mechanical support.},

abstract = {Virtually all plants show a certain degree of variation among individual metamers during ontogeny. In some cases, however, there are abrupt and substantial changes in form and function (e.g. in leaf form, leaf size, phyllotaxy, internode length, anthocyanin pigmentation, rooting ability, or wood structure). These plants were called “heteroblastic” by Karl Goebel more than a century ago, but the functional significance of this type of ontogenetic change, the evolutionary trajectories in different plant groups, even their frequency in the plant kingdom are still unresolved issues. We argue that slow progress is partly due to an on-going terminological confusion and the lack of distinction between other developmental processes such as ontogenetic drift. This review develops a conceptual framework for future scientific work, proposes a quantitative index of heteroblasty, and discusses the evidence for developmental regulation, functional significance, and evolutionary implications of heteroblasty to provide a stimulating basis for further research with this fascinating group of plants.},

abstract = {Adaptive trade-offs underlie the specialisation that permits habitat partitioning in species rich plant communities. We investigated the influence of the trade-offs that determine differences in growth and survival among six species of neotropical pioneer trees in gaps in semideciduous forest in Panama. Seedlings of Miconia argentea, Cecropia insignis, Luehea seemannii, Trema micrantha, Ochroma pyramidale and Croton bilbergianus were planted into artificial small (25 m(2)), medium (64 m(2)) and large (225 m(2)) gaps in secondary forest in the Barro Colorado Nature Monument. Trema and Ochroma suffered {\textgreater}/=50{\%} mortality across all gap sizes, while Cecropia had high mortality only during the dry season and in the small gaps, and Miconia and Croton suffered low to zero mortality across all environments. The highest growth rates in large gaps were attained by Cecropia seedlings and in the smaller gaps by Miconia seedlings, although there were indications that Trema and Ochroma required gaps that were larger than any used in this study. Variation in growth and mortality could not be attributed to differences in foliar herbivore damage. Instead, there was strong evidence of a trade-off between maximum growth in the wet season and the ability to survive seasonal drought, particularly in small gaps. We conclude that variation in allocation in response to multiple limiting resources may be as important as allocation to growth and defence in determining the habitat preferences of neotropical pioneers.},

abstract = {It has been suggested that tropical forest and savanna could represent alternative stable states, implying critical transitions at tipping points in response to altered climate or other drivers. So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation. These results allow the identification of regions where forest or savanna may most easily tip into an alternative state, and they pave the way to a new generation of coupled climate models.},

abstract = {The rapid increase of carbon dioxide concentration in Earth's modern atmosphere is a matter of major concern. But for the atmosphere of roughly two-and-half billion years ago, interest centres on a different gas: free oxygen (O 2) spawned by early biological production. The initial increase of O 2 in the atmosphere, its delayed build-up in the ocean, its increase to near-modern levels in the sea and air two billion years later, and its cause-and-effect relationship with life are among the most compelling stories in Earth's history. M ost of us take our richly oxygenated world for granted and expect to find O 2 everywhere—after all, it makes up 21{\%} of the modern atmosphere. But free oxygen, at levels mostly less than 0.001{\%} of those present in the atmosphere today, was anything but plentiful during the first half of Earth's 4.5-billion-year history. Evidence for a permanent rise to appreciable concentrations of O 2 in the atmo-sphere some time between 2.4 and 2.1 billion years (Gyr) ago (Fig. 1) began to accumulate as early as the 1960s 1},

abstract = {Soil respiration, R(S), the flux of microbially and plant-respired carbon dioxide (CO(2)) from the soil surface to the atmosphere, is the second-largest terrestrial carbon flux. However, the dynamics of R(S) are not well understood and the global flux remains poorly constrained. Ecosystem warming experiments, modelling analyses and fundamental biokinetics all suggest that R(S) should change with climate. This has been difficult to confirm observationally because of the high spatial variability of R(S), inaccessibility of the soil medium and the inability of remote-sensing instruments to measure R(S) on large scales. Despite these constraints, it may be possible to discern climate-driven changes in regional or global R(S) values in the extant four-decade record of R(S) chamber measurements. Here we construct a database of worldwide R(S) observations matched with high-resolution historical climate data and find a previously unknown temporal trend in the R(S) record after accounting for mean annual climate, leaf area, nitrogen deposition and changes in CO(2) measurement technique. We find that the air temperature anomaly (the deviation from the 1961-1990 mean) is significantly and positively correlated with changes in R(S). We estimate that the global R(S) in 2008 (that is, the flux integrated over the Earth's land surface over 2008) was 98 +/- 12 Pg C and that it increased by 0.1 Pg C yr(-1) between 1989 and 2008, implying a global R(S) response to air temperature (Q(10)) of 1.5. An increasing global R(S) value does not necessarily constitute a positive feedback to the atmosphere, as it could be driven by higher carbon inputs to soil rather than by mobilization of stored older carbon. The available data are, however, consistent with an acceleration of the terrestrial carbon cycle in response to global climate change.},

abstract = {The generation and conduction of neuronal action potentials (APs) were the subjects of a cell physiology exercise for first-year medical students. In this activity, students demonstrated the all-or-none nature of AP generation, measured conduction velocity, and examined the dependence of the threshold stimulus amplitude on stimulus duration. For this purpose, they used the median giant nerve fiber (MGF) in the ventral nerve cord of the common earthworm (Lumbricus terrestris). Here, we introduce a specialized stimulation and recording chamber that the nonanesthetized earthworm enters completely unforced. The worm resides in a narrow round duct with silver electrodes on the bottom such that individual APs of the MGF can be elicited and recorded superficially. Our experimental setup combines several advantages: it allows noninvasive single fiber AP measurements taken from a nonanesthetized animal that is yet restrained. Students performed the experiments with a high success rate. According to the data acquired by the students, the mean conduction velocity of the MGF was 30.2 m/s. From the amplitude-duration relationship for threshold stimulation, rheobase and chronaxie were graphically determined by the students according to Lapicque's method. The mean rheobase was 1.01 V, and the mean chronaxie was 0.06 ms. The acquired data and analysis results are of high quality, as deduced from critical examination based on the law of Weiss. In addition, we provide video material, which was also used in the practical course.},

abstract = {Abstract Rates of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition are increasing rapidly in tropical regions, which are projected to receive some of the greatest deposition levels globally in the coming decades. Tropical forests on highly weathered soils generally have high N availability, so added N is not likely to stimulate plant growth. Instead, N addition to these soils may rapidly alter the availability of other scarcer nutrients like base cations, via displacement from soil exchange sites and mobilization into solution. We hypothesized that: (1.) Addition of mineral N to highly weathered tropical soils rapidly mobilizes base cations into solution, with increasing fertilization effects over time. (2.) Nitrogen fertilization reduces cation availability on soil exchange sites, because of increased mobilization and loss down the soil profile. We assessed the short-term (1–2 year) and mid-term (4–5 year) effects of N fertilization on base cation mobilization to 40 cm depths in two distinct tropical forests. Over the first 5 years of the experiment, fertilization significantly increased calcium, magnesium, and potassium concentrations in soil solution, as well as all dissolved N chemical species. There was an increasing fertilization effect over time for all solutes across soil depths, suggestive of downward leaching. Comparing the two forests, there was no difference in the magnitude or timing of the fertilization effect on base cation mobilization, although dissolved N concentrations increased most rapidly in the upper elevation forest, where background dissolved N was also higher. Surprisingly, salt-extractable base cations also increased for fertilized versus control soils. Our results suggest that addition of mineral N to tropical forests on highly weathered soils is highly likely to mobilize base cations into solution, with subsequent leaching down the soil profile. These results imply that N deposition in tropical forests on highly weathered soils may exacerbate cation scarcity in these ecosystems, and could negatively affect long-term plant growth},

abstract = {Tropical nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to increase substantially within the coming decades. Increases in soil emissions of the climate-relevant trace gases NO and N2O are expected, but few studies address this possibility. We used N addition experiments to achieve N-enriched conditions in contrasting montane and lowland forests and assessed changes in the timing and magnitude of soil N-oxide emissions.We evaluated transitory effects, which occurred immediately after N addition, and long-term effects measured at least 6 weeks after N addition. In the montane forest where stem growth was N limited, the first-time N additions caused rapid increases in soil N-oxide emissions. During the first 2 years of N addition, annual N-oxide emissions were five times (transitory effect) and two times (long-term effect) larger than controls. This contradicts the current assumption that N-limited tropical montane forests will respond to N additions with only small and delayed increases in soil N-oxide emissions. We attribute this fast and large response of soil N-oxide emissions to the presence of an organic layer (a character- istic feature of this forest type) in which nitrification increased substantially followingN addition. In the lowland forest where stem growth was neither N nor phosphorus (P) limited, the first-time N additions caused only gradual and minimal increases in soil N-oxide emissions. These first N additions were completed at the beginning of the wet season, and low soil water content may have limited nitrification. In contrast, the 9- and 10-year N-addition plots displayed instantaneous and large soil N-oxide emissions. Annual N-oxide emissions under chronic N addition were seven times (transitory effect) and four times (long-term effect) larger than controls. Seasonal changes in soil water content also caused seasonal changes in soil N-oxide emissions from the 9- and 10-year N-addition plots. This suggests that climate change scenarios, where rainfall quantity and seasonality change, will alter the relative importance of soil NO and N2O emissions from tropical forests exposed to elevated N deposition.},

abstract = {The distribution of vegetation types in Venezuelan Guyana tin the ('Canaima' National Park) represents a transitional stage in a long term process of savannization. a process considered to be conditioned by a combined chemical and intermittent drought stress. All types of woody vegetation in this environment accumulate large amounts of Litter and soil organic carbon (SOC). We hypothesized that this accumulation is caused by low microbial activity. During 1 year we measured microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), microbial respiration and soil respiration of stony Oxisols (Acrohumox) at a tall. a medium and a low forest and with three chemical modifications of site conditions by the addition of NO3-, Ca2+ and PO43- as possible limiting elements. Due to high SOC contents, mean Cmic was 1 mg g soil(-1) in the mineral topsoil and 3 mg g soil(-1) in the forest floor. Mean microbial respiration in the mineral topsoil and the forest Boor were 165 and 192 mug CO2- g soil(-1) d(-1), respectively. We calculated high mean metabolic quotients (qCO(2)) of 200 mg CO2-C g Cmic(-1) d(-1) in the litter layer and 166 mg CO2-C g Cmic(-1) d(-1) in the mineral topsoil. while the Cmic-to-SOC ratios were as low as 1.0{\%} in the litter layer and 0.8{\%} in the mineral topsoil. Annual soil respiration was 9. 12 and 10 Mg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) in the tall, medium and low forest, respectively. CO2 production was significantly increased by CaHPO4 fertilization, but no consistent effects were caused by Ca2+ and NO3-, fertilization. Our findings indicate that Cmic and microbial respiration are reduced by low nutrient concentrations and low litter and SOC quality. Reduced microbial decomposition may have contributed to SOC accumulation in these forests. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. We tested the generality of global leaf trait relationships among 44 tropical plant species from a broad array of growth forms (trees, lianas and understorey plants) in lowland Panama to determine how leaf trait relationships vary with whole-plant morphology within one site. 2. We observed significant variation among growth forms for seven out of 10 leaf traits. Variation in leaf traits among growth forms was more pronounced per area than per mass. Thirteen bivariate leaf trait relationships that describe how plants allocate resources to photosynthesis were significant across all species. Growth forms showed distinct slopes, intercepts or shifts in the common slope for 12 of the 13 relationships. 3. Trait relationships within trees and lianas showed good agreement with a global leaf trait data set. However, for understorey plants, trait relationships that included specific leaf area (SLA) deviated from the global data set, suggesting that understorey leaf- allocation patterns optimize SLA, and hence growth. 4. Lianas showed lower values and rates of gas exchange than trees, and longer leaf life span for a given SLA, illustrating variation in leaf traits associated with growth form and canopy geometry. 5. Functional variation in allocation to photosynthetic capacity among tropical forest species is related to microhabitat variations in light availability and whole-plant morphology among growth forms.},

abstract = {Variation in life history strategies is a fundamental question in evolutionary biology, and the cooccurrence of annual and perennial habits in Castilleja and Castillejinae provides the opportunity to study the evolution of plant life history in a phylogenetic context. Molecular phylogenetic analysis of two chloroplast (rps16 and trnL/F) and two nuclear ribosomal (internal and external transcribed spacers) DNA regions support the monophyly of subtribe Castillejinae (Orobanchaceae). A well-supported phylogeny of the six genera (Castilleja [∼180 spp.], Clevelandia [1 sp.], Cordylanthus [18 spp.], Ophiocephalus [1 sp.], Orthocarpus [9 spp.], and Triphysaria [5 spp.]) comprising the subtribe is presented, and morphological synapomorphies are identified for the major lineages recovered. Orthocarpus and Triphysaria are both monophyletic; Cordylanthus is biphyletic. Clevelandia and Ophiocephalus are derived from within Castilleja. The perennial Castilleja clade (∼160 spp.) is derived from a grade of annual taxa including Castilleja sect. Oncorhynchus (16 spp.), Cordylanthus, Orthocarpus, and Triphysaria. This suggests that the perennial habit evolved a single time from an annual ancestral lineage that persisted throughout the diversification of Castillejinae, contrary to classical interpretations of life history evolution in plants. Given the prevalence of polyploidy among perennial Castilleja species, perenniality may have played an important role in the origin and establishment of polyploidy in Castilleja.},

abstract = {Microneurography and the use of selective microelectrodes that can resolve single-unit nerve activity have become a tool to understand the coding within the nervous system and a clinical diagnostic tool to assess peripheral neural pathologies. Central to these techniques is the use of the differences in the shape of the extracellular action potential (AP) waveform to identify and discriminate units from one another. Theoretical modeling of the origins of these shape differences has shown that the position of the nerve fiber relative to the electrode and the conduction velocity of the unit contribute to these differences giving rise to the hypothesis that more information about the fiber and its relationship to the electrode could be extracted given further analysis of the AP waveform. This paper addresses this question by exploring the electrical coupling between the electrode and nerve fiber. Idealized models and the literature indicate that two parameters, the electrode-fiber distance and the unit conduction velocity, contribute to the amplitude of the extracellular AP detected by the electrode, which confounds the quantification of coupling using the spike amplitude alone. To resolve this, we develop a method that enables differential quantification of these two parameters using spectral analysis of the single-unit AP waveform and demonstrate that the two parameters could be effectively decoupled in an in vitro earthworm model. The method could open the way forward toward micro-scale in situ monitoring of the interaction of nerve fiber and neural interface.},

abstract = {Vaccinium meridionale is a promising crop for the Andean region of South America and is currently available only in the wild. Spontaneous populations of this plant are found across the Colombian mountains, but very few published records on this plant morphology are available. A zonification study of V. meridionale was conducted in four principal areas of a low mountain forest of Colombia (Provinces of Boyac{\'{a}}, Cundinamarca, Santander and Nari{\~{n}}o) in 2007. A total of 20 populations and 100 plants of V. meridionale were individually characterized and surveyed, using a list of 26 characters of morphological variables (9 quantitative and 17 quali- tative characters). Our results indicated that natural populations of V. meridionale might be found in the tropical forest under a highly heterogeneous climate and microclimate conditions, at different mountain regions between 2 357 and 3 168masl. The shrubs of V. meridionale exhibited a high level of intra-population variation in sev- eral quantitative (plant height, stem diameter) and qualitative (growth habit, ramification density, presence of anthocyanins in stems) morphological characters, suggesting an environmentally induced phenotypic plasticity. Plant height, stem diameter and foliar density were the most variable morphological traits, with coefficients of variation higher than 50{\%}. However, several quantitative characters of its reproductive potential, such as berry dimensions, rachis length and number of flowers per inflorescence, resulted with low plasticity with coefficients of variation lower than 30.2{\%}, indicating that these characters were genetically determined. The highest correla- tion coefficients (p{\textless}0.05) resulted to be between fruit length and fruit width (0.90), leaf length and leaf width (0.78), plant height and stem diameter (0.60), and inflorescence length and flowers number per inflorescence (0.57). The results suggest that an important genetic resource exists for this species in the wild. Low variation in fruit size, which constitutes a target trait for plant breeders, could be useful for selection of cultivars of V. meridionale. The results of this study could also be applied in conservation programs aimed to protect these diverse populations in the mountain forests of Colombia. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (2): 569-583.

abstract = {Quantification of microbial activities involved in soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition is critical for the prediction of the long-term impact of climate change on soil respiration (SR) and SOC stock. Although the temperature sensitivity of SR is especially critical in semi-arid regions, such as North West Tunisia, where the SOC stock is low, little research has been carried out in these environments. More needs to be known about factors, such as SOC availability that influence temperature sensitivity. In this study, soil samples were incubated with and without glucose addition for 28 days after a 28-day pre-incubation period. Pre-incubation and incubation was carried out at 20°C, 30°C, 40°C and 50°C. Respiration measurements were taken with temperature, glucose addition and incubation time as independent variables. The highest pre-incubation temperature reduced the temperature sensitivity of SR during the subsequent incubation period, both with and without glucose addition. Soil samples pre-incubated at 50°C had the lowest SR at all subsequent incubation temperatures and the lowest temperature sensitivity of SR, even after glucose addition. However, after glucose addition, the effect of a high pre-incubation temperature on soil respiration lasted only two days. Measuring the water-soluble carbon (WSC) in soil samples suggested that the high pre-incubation temperature may have killed part of the microbial biomass, modified microbial communities or solubilized SOC. For quantifying the possible effect of global warming, in particular heat waves, on soil respiration in the soil studied, the results indicate a moderate response of soil respiration to temperature at high temperatures, as shown by Q10close to 1.7, even in the range 40-50°C. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

A factorial experiment used all combinations of three fertilizer treatments: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and a mix of other essential nutrients (OE), consisting primarily of mineral derived cations and excluding N and P. P addition, but not N or OE, increased leaf area index within 12 months, foliar P concentration measured at 18 months, and stem diameter increment within 18 months. Stem growth at 18 months was even greater when trees fertilized with P also received the OE treatment. N and P additions increased leaf litterfall and N and P in combination further increased litterfall. The sequence of responses suggests that increased available P promoted an increase in photosynthetic area which led to increased wood production. P was the essential element most limiting to primary production on old volcanic soil in contrast to the N limitation found on young volcanic soils.},

abstract = {Fertilizer trials of a standard design were established in experimental plantations of Eucalyptus regnans, Eucalyptus nitens and Eucalyptus globulus on sites of high potential productivity in Gippsland, southeastern Australia. The design involved factorial combinations of three rates of N (up to 400 kg ha-1 elemental) and four rates of P (up to 200 kg ha-1) with four additional treatments including K and trace elements. Treatments were complete after up to four applications at 2, 9, 14 and 26 months post- planting. P additions significantly increased foliar P concentrations and growth of E. regnans to 45 months but poor survival and competition from woody weeds limited growth responses to treatments. Foliar concentrations of N and P in E. nitens and E. globulus at age 1 year were significantly increased by N and P additions and were positively correlated with both early and later growth. Added P significantly decreased the foliar N to P ratios of all species at age 1 year, indicating that P additions, in particular, were required for good early growth. Combined additions of N and P significantly increased growth of E. nitens in the first year but growth responses to further additions of fertilizer were minimal. In contrast, growth of E. globulus increased in response to all fertilizer additions, leading to the greatest mean volumes at the highest combined rates of N and P. Relative gains in productivity were therefore greater in E. globulus (m.a.i. range at 71 months: 10-24 m3 ha-1 year-1) than E. nitens (16-33 m3 ha-1 year-1). There were no additional growth responses of any species to added K or trace elements. However, concentrations of K in E. regnans foliage at age 1 year were increased by K additions and were correlated with later growth. Low concentrations of Mg in E. nitens foliage suggest a probable response to Mg additions. General fertilizer prescriptions for the establishment phase of eucalypt plantations on sites of high quality are presented. Refinement of these prescriptions will rely on a better understanding of the nutritional requirements of individual species.},

The project was developed on the campus of EARTH University, located in Mercedes de Gu{\'{a}}cimo, province of Lim{\'{o}}n, in the Atlantic region of Costa Rica. It was demonstrated that the region has very little landscaping culture and where people's perception of landscaping tends to be very conventional, emphasizing orderly and geometric forms, defined limits, introduced species and pruned areas of turf grass and hedges. For the purpose of developing natural landscaping in the region in terms of education and information, a naturally landscaped garden was designed and executed at the hostel of the Permanent Education Program of EARTH University. The objectives of the proposal were achieved, including: the use of the proposed species, reduced implementation labor, a reduction in the area of turf grass, client satisfaction, and the combination in spontaneous and natural way vegetable and non-vegetable elements with the natural and architectural surroundings. The garden provides an unusual and attractive aspect to the institution.

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to increase significantly in tropical regions in the coming decades, where changes in climate are also expected. Additional N and warming each have the potential to alter soil carbon (C) storage via changes in microbial activity and decomposition, but little is known about the combined effects of these global change factors in tropical ecosystems. In this study, we used controlled laboratory incubations of soils from a long-term N fertilization experiment to explore the sensitivity of soil C to increased N in two N-rich tropical forests. We found that fertilization corresponded to significant increases in bulk soil C concentrations, and decreases in C loss via heterotrophic respiration (P {\textless} 0.05). The increase in soil C was not uniform among C pools, however. The active soil C pool decomposed faster with fertilization, while slowly cycling C pools had longer turnover times. These changes in soil C cycling with N additions corresponded to the responses of two groups of microbial extracellular enzymes. Smaller active C pools corresponded to increased hydrolytic enzyme activities; longer turnover times of the slowly cycling C pool corresponded to reduced activity of oxidative enzymes, which degrade more complex C compounds, in fertilized soils. Warming increased soil respiration overall, and N fertilization significantly increased the temperature sensitivity of slowly cycling C pools in both forests. In the lower elevation forest, respired CO(2) from fertilized cores had significantly higher delta 14C values than control soils, indicating losses of relatively older soil C. These results indicate that soil C storage is sensitive to both N deposition and warming in N-rich tropical soils, with interacting effects of these two global change factors. N deposition has the potential to increase total soil C stocks in tropical forests, but the long-term stability of this added C will likely depend on future changes in temperature.},

abstract = {Palatability of parasitic plants may be influenced by their host species, because the parasites take up nutrients and secondary compounds from the hosts. If parasitic plants acquired the full spectrum of secondary compounds from their host, one would expect a correlation between host and parasite palatability. We examined the palatability of leaves of the root-hemiparasite Melampyrum arvense grown with different host plants and the palatability of these host plants for two generalist herbivores, the caterpillar of Spodoptera littoralis and the slug Arion lusitanicus. We used 19 species of host plants from 11 families that are known to contain a wide spectrum of anti-herbivore compounds. Growth of M. arvense was strongly influenced by the host species. The palatability of the individual host species for the two herbivores differed strongly. Both A. lusitanicus and S. littoralis discriminated also between hemiparasites grown with different host plants. There was no correlation between the palatability of a host species and that of the parasites grown on that host, i.e., hemiparasites grown on palatable host species were not more palatable than those grown on unpalatable hosts. We suggest an interacting pattern of specific effects of chemical anti-herbivore defences and indirect effects of the hosts on herbivores through effects on growth and tissue quality of the parasites.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition is generally considered to increase soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emission in N-rich forests. In many tropical forests, however, elevated N deposition has caused soil N enrichment and further phosphorus (P) deficiency, and the interaction of N and P to control soil N2O emission remains poorly understood, particularly in forests with different soil N status. In this study, we examined the effects of N and P additions on soil N2O emission in an N-rich old-growth forest and two N-limited younger forests (a mixed and a pine forest) in southern China, to test the following hypotheses: (1) soil N2O emission is the highest in old-growth forest due to the N-rich soil; (2) N addition increases N2O emission more in the old-growth forest than in the two younger forests; (3) P addition decreases N O emission more in the old-growth forest than in the two younger forests; and (4) P addition alleviates the stimulation of N2O emission by N addition. The following four treatments were established in each forest: Control, N addition (150 kg N ha–1 yr–1), P addition (150 kg P ha–1 yr–1), and NP addition (150 kg N ha–1 yr–1 plus 150 kg P ha–1 yr–1). From February 2007 to October 2009, monthly quantification of soil N2O emission was performed using static chamber and gas chromatography techniques. Mean N2O emission was shown to be significantly higher in the old-growth forest (13.86 ± 0.71 $\mu$g N2O-N m–2 h–1) than in the mixed (9.86 ± 0.38 $\mu$g N2O-N m–2 h–1) or pine (10.83 ± 0.52 $\mu$g N) forests, with no significant difference between the latter two. N addition significantly increased N2O emission in the old-growth forest but not in the two younger forests. However, both P- and NP-addition had no significant effect on N2O emission in all three forests, suggesting that P addition alleviated the stimulation of N2O emission by N addition in the old-growth forest. Although P fertilization may alleviate the stimulated effects of atmospheric N deposition on N O emission in N-rich forests, we suggest future investigations to definitively assess this management strategy and the importance of P in regulating N cycles from regional to global scales.},

The 90{\%} of litter falling as leaves and twigs failed to increase with fertilization, but reproductive litter (fruits and flowers) increased by 43{\%} with N. K enhanced cellulose decomposition; one or more micronutrients enhanced leaf-litter decomposition; P enhanced both. Our results suggest tropical forests are a non-Liebig world of multiple nutrient limitations, with at least four elements shaping rates of litterfall and decomposition. Multiple metallomic enzymes and cofactors likely create gradients in the break down of leaf litter. Selection favours individuals that make more propagules, and even in an N-rich forest, N is a non-substitutable resource for reproduction.},

The montane regions ({\textgreater}2000 m MSL) of the Western Ghats in southern India feature stunted ever-green forests (C3 plant type) interspersed with extensive grasslands (C3 or C4 plant types). We have studied the vegetational history of this ecosystem in relation to climate change during the late Quaternary through stable-carbon isotope analysis of peat deposits as indicators of C3 or C4 plant types. Grasslands (of C4 type) were predominant during the last glacial maximum (20-18 kyr BP) and again during 6-3.5 kyr BP, while forest and possibly C3 grassland expanded during the deglaciation, attaining their peak distribution at 10 kyr BP. The shift in C3 and C4 plant types seems related to changes in moisture and atmospheric C02, with lower moisture and CO2 levels favouring the latter plant types.

Conclusions and outlook 21 Acknowledgements 22 References 22 Summary It is the aim of this review to present a monographic survey of the neotropical genus Clusia on scaling levels from molecular phylogeny, metabolism, photosynthesis and autecological environmental responses to ecological amplitude and synecological habitat impact. Clusia is the only dicotyledonous genus with real trees performing crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). By way of introduction, a brief historical reminiscence describes the discovery of CAM in Clusia and the consequent increase in interest in studying this particular genus of tropical shrubs and trees. The molecular phylogeny of CAM in the genus is compared with that in Kalancho{\"{e}} and the Bromeliaceae. At the level of metabolism and photosynthesis, the great plasticity of expression of photosynthetic physiotypes, i.e. (i) C(3) photosynthesis, (ii) CAM including CAM idling, (iii) CAM cycling and (iv) C(3)/CAM-intermediate behaviour, as well as metabolic flexibility in Clusia is illustrated. At the level of autecology, the factors water, irradiance and temperature, which control photosynthetic flexibility, are assessed. The phenotypic plasticity of physiotypes and morphotypes is described. At the level of synecology, the ecological amplitude of Clusia in the tropics and the relations to habitat are surveyed.},

abstract = {Global warming is predicted to be most pronounced at high latitudes, and observational evidence over the past 25 years suggests that this warming is already under way. One-third of the global soil carbon pool is stored in northern latitudes, so there is considerable interest in understanding how the carbon balance of northern ecosystems will respond to climate warming. Observations of controls over plant productivity in tundra and boreal ecosystems have been used to build a conceptual model of response to warming, where warmer soils and increased decomposition of plant litter increase nutrient availability, which, in turn, stimulates plant production and increases ecosystem carbon storage. Here we present the results of a long-term fertilization experiment in Alaskan tundra, in which increased nutrient availability caused a net ecosystem loss of almost 2,000 grams of carbon per square meter over 20 years. We found that annual aboveground plant production doubled during the experiment. Losses of carbon and nitrogen from deep soil layers, however, were substantial and more than offset the increased carbon and nitrogen storage in plant biomass and litter. Our study suggests that projected release of soil nutrients associated with high-latitude warming may further amplify carbon release from soils, causing a net loss of ecosystem carbon and a positive feedback to climate warming.},

Mature gonads and egg masses were, however, only present from September–November, suggesting the larvae from the two settlement pulses originated from other locations as well as Hong Kong populations. Settlement intensity and post-recruitment mortality of the two species varied between sites, pos- sibly due to spatial variation in free rock space, physical transport of larvae and abundance of food in the water column.},

abstract = {Investigators working in both terrestrial and marine systems hypothesize that prey defenses are better developed in tropical than in temperate habitats because tropical consumers are more active and diverse. To investigate the hypothesis that chemical defenses are more potent in tropical than in temperate seaweeds, we conducted 38 feeding assays involving seven genera of algae. We offered tropical and temperate sea urchins the choice of a temperate alga from North Carolina or a closely related tropical alga from the Bahamas. Plants were freeze-dried, ground to a fine powder, embedded in agar, and presented in congeneric pairs (North Carolina species vs. Bahamian species), or same-species pairs, to the temperate urchin Arbacia punctulata and the tropical urchin Lytechinus variegatus. For the genera we tested (the red alga Amphiroa, the green alga Udotea, and the brown algae Dictyopteris, Dictyota, Lobophora, Padina, and Sargassum), we documented a general pattern in which the mean amount of North Carolina seaweeds eaten was approximately twice that of their Bahamian congeners. Dictyota was an exception to the overall pattern, in that mean consumption of temperate and tropical species was equivalent. In addition to showing a latitudinal difference in seaweed palatability, we found that some species ex- hibited significant, between-population variation in herbivore resistance on a local scale. The most notable example was Dictyota menstrualis from North Carolina. When collected from a shallow inshore site, this species was significantly more palatable than tropical species of Dictyota in four of six contrasts. When collected from a deeper offshore site, it was significantly less palatable than the tropical species in four of six contrasts. Thus, for this species, the between-population variance in palatability within a geographic region (North Carolina) bracketed the variance in palatability that we found among species and between regions. Feeding assays with both temperate and tropical urchins produced similar results, in- dicating that choices were made based on fundamental characteristics of the algae rather than on greater familiarity with local prey species. To see if chemical defenses could explain the differences in herbivore resistance that we noted using freeze-dried algae, we tested the effects of lipid-soluble and water-soluble extracts from each alga on urchin feeding by incorporating extracts into a standard palatable food. We also measured protein content and percent ash-free dry mass of the seaweeds in order to correlate urchin feeding preferences with these measures of food quality. Lipophilic chemical extracts explained urchin pref- erences in 9 of 15 (60{\%}) North Carolina-Bahamas contrasts. Water-soluble extracts, protein content, and percent ash-free dry mass generally did not account for feeding patterns seen in the original assays. Our results support the general hypothesis that tropical seaweeds have stronger chemical defenses than temperate seaweeds. For some genera, however, smaller-scale local variability in herbivore resistance within a species can be as striking as overall latitudinal differences.},

abstract = {In South Brazil, female Heliconius erato phyllis (Fabricius) lay isolated eggs on branch tips of Passiflora suberosa Linnaeus, leading to early lalvae first contacting young host plant tissues. These feed on young tissues, but the adaptive meaning, if any, for such an asso- ciation is still unknown. In this paper, we determine what leaf ages are usually consumed by each instar, the existence of feeding preference in relation to leaf age, and the performance of H erato when fed either on young or old leaves of P suberosa under laboratory conditions. Freshly- hatched larvae were transferred to the terminal portion of isolated, intact shoots, and observed daily for order of leaf choice until pupation. Feeding preference in relation to leaf age was evaluated for all instars through choice tests using leaf disks from young and mature leaves. Ad- ditionally to evaluate induction of feeding preference, lalvae were reared through fourth ins tar on either young or mature leaves and then tested using the same choice procedure. Growth performance was assessed by progreSSively transfering larvae, according to instar number, from intact shoots to sections where apical portion was cut off. Larvae fed starting at the terminal bud (young tissues) and moving progreSSively to lower leaves of increaSing age (mature leaves ). Larvae of all instal'S consumed more young leaf disks, and preference for old leaves could not be in- duced. Larvae reared initially on young tissues had greater survivorship and grew faster than those on mature, and this may explain the oviposi- tion site selection and larval feeding preference of this butterfly.},

abstract = {South American temperate forests are of special conservation concern due to their highly endemic flora and fauna, and the occurrence of unique plant-animal interactions. Yet, knowledge regarding gall inducers diversity is limited although increasing rapidly in the last two decades. Here, we performed a review of the literature, supplemented with field collected data by the authors, in order to provide the most up to date knowledge of gall inducers' diversity associated with native woody species of the temperate forest of Chile and Argentina. We present data for 90 morphospecies of galls associated with 39 host-plant species (21 genera, 15 families), spanning insects and arachnids of at least 6 orders and nematodes. Most of this richness is associated to the best surveyed host-plant genus, Nothofagus, with up to 43 morphospecies of galls in just 8 dominant tree species. Moreover, we provide evidence that gall species richness across all woody host-plant species decreases with elevation, probably driven by decreased temperature and number of available host-plant species. However, this overall trend vary among host plant species and scales of observation. Overall, the study of gall diversity and the biotic and abiotic factors that shape their distribution in these austral forests offer an exciting and fertile field for future research. Besides emphasizing the need for more in depth taxonomic and diversity studies of the gall fauna of these forests, we propose several future lines of research that promise to further elucidate our understanding of the evolution of plant-gall interactions in these forests.},

abstract = {The Drosophila Methoprene-tolerant (Met) and Germ cell-expressed (Gce) bHLH-PAS transcription factors are products of two paralogous genes. Both proteins potentially mediate the effect of juvenile hormone (JH) as candidate JH receptors. Here we report that Met and Gce are partially redundant in transducing JH action. Both Met and g. ce null single mutants are fully viable, but the Met gce double mutant, Met 27 gce 2.5k, dies during the larval-pupal transition. Precocious and enhanced caspase-dependent programmed cell death (PCD) appears in fat body cells of Met 27 gce 2.5k during the early larval stages. Expression of Kr-h1, a JH response gene that inhibits 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E)-induced broad (br) expression, is abolished in Met 27 gce 2.5k during larval molts. Consequently, expression of br occurs precociously in Met 27 gce 2.5k, which m??ay cause precocious caspase-dependent PCD during the early larval stages. Defective phenotypes and gene expression changes in Met 27 gce 2.5k double mutants are similar to those found in JH-deficient animals. Importantly, exogenous application of JH agonists rescued the JH-deficient animals but not the Met 27 gce 2.5k mutants. Our data suggest a model in which Drosophila Met and Gce redundantly transduce JH action to prevent 20E-induced caspase-dependent PCD during larval molts by induction of Kr-h1 expression and inhibition of br expression. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {1. The cycling of nutrients in litterfall is considered a key mechanism in the maintenance of tropical forest fertility but its importance has rarely been quantified experimentally. 2. We carried out a long-term (5 years), large-scale litter manipulation experiment in lowland semi-evergreen tropical forest to determine how changes in litterfall affect forest nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that: (i) long-term litter removal would decrease the forest's nutrient supply; (ii) litter addition would increase the forest's nutrient supply; (iii) soil and foliar nutrient concentrations would change in response to litter manipulation and would eventually affect above-ground productivity. 3. To test our hypotheses, we measured trunk growth, litterfall, and nutrient concentrations in live leaves, litter and soil in plots where litter was removed once a month (L−), litter was added once a month (L+) and controls (CT). 4. After 5 years, the concentration of nitrate in the soil and soil stocks of inorganic nitrogen were higher in the L+ plots and lower in the L− plots compared to the controls. Ammonium concentrations in the soil were also lower in the L− plots. Nitrogen in leaves and litter and the annual nitrogen return by litter were higher in the L+ plots, while potassium return was lower in the L− plots. Surprisingly, our treatments had little effect on phosphorus in soil, leaves or litter, even though lowland tropical forests are generally thought to be largely phosphorus limited. 5. Trunk growth of large trees was not affected by litter manipulation but rainy season litterfall from 2003 to 2008 was 13{\%} higher in the L+ plots compared to the controls. 6. Synthesis. Litter removal affected forest nutrient cycling and productivity less than expected, probably because the soil at our site is moderately fertile. However, litter addition increased litterfall indicating that some limitation of forest production was removed by litter addition. We expected strong effects of litter manipulation on phosphorus cycling; instead, we found a stronger effect on nitrogen cycling. Our results suggest that litter is an important source of nutrients, in particular nitrogen, to trees in this lowland semi-evergreen tropical forest.},

abstract = {How tropical forest carbon stocks might alter in response to changes in climate and atmospheric composition is uncertain. However, assessing potential future carbon loss from tropical forests is important for evaluating the efficacy of programmes for reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation. Uncertainties are associated with different carbon stock re- sponses in models with different representations of vegetation processes on the one hand1–3, and differences in projected changes in temperature and precipitation patterns on the other hand4,5. Here we present a systematic exploration of these sources of uncertainty, along with uncertainty arising from different emissions scenarios for all three main tropical forest regions: the Americas (that is,Amazonia andCentral America), Africa and Asia. Using simulations with 22 climate models and the MOSES–TRIFFID land surface scheme, we find that only in one5 of the simulations are tropical forests projected to lose biomass by the end of the twenty-first century—and then only for the Americas. When comparing with alternative models of plant physiological processes1,2, we find that the largest un- certainties are associated with plant physiological responses, and then with future emissions scenarios. Uncertainties from differences in the climate projections are significantly smaller. Despite the considerable uncertainties, we conclude that there is evidence of forest resilience for all three regions. Tropical},

abstract = {Acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration in shoots and ecosystem carbon dioxide fluxes to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration (C(a)) was studied in a brackish wetland. Open top chambers were used to create test atmospheres of normal ambient and elevated C(a)(= normal ambient + 34 Pa CO2) over mono-specific stands of the C3 sedge Scirpus olneyi, the dominant C3 species in the wetland ecosystem, throughout each growing season since April of 1987. Acclimation of photosynthesis and respiration were evaluated by measurements of gas exchange in excised shoots. The impact of elevated C(a) on the accumulation of carbon in the ecosystem was determined by ecosystem gas exchange measurements made using the open top chamber as a cuvette. Elevated C(a) increased carbohydrate and reduced Rubisco and soluble protein concentrations as well as photosynthetic capacity(A) and dark respiration (R(d); dry weight basis) in excised shoots and canopies (leaf area area basis) of Scirpus olneyi. Nevertheless, the rate of photosynthesis was stimulated 53{\%} in shoots and 30{\%} in canopies growing in elevated C(a) compared to normal ambient concentration. Elevated C(a) inhibited R(d) measured in excised shoots (- 19 to -40{\%}) and in seasonally integrated ecosystem respiration (R(e); -36 to -57{\%}). Growth of shoots in elevated C(a) was stimulated 14-21{\%}, but this effect was not statistically significant at peak standing biomass in midseason. Although the effect of elevated C(a) on growth of shoots was relatively small, the combined effect of increased number of shoots and stimulation of photosynthesis produced a 30{\%} stimulation in seasonally integrated gross primary production (GPP). The stimulation of photosynthesis and inhibition of respiration by elevated C(a) increased net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP - R(e) 59{\%} in 1993 and 50{\%} in 1994. While this study consistently showed that elevated C(a) produced a significant increase in NEP, we have not identified a correspondingly large pool of carbon below ground.},

abstract = {The morphology of Genipa americana seeds and post-seminal development was studied, and its germination response investigated in relation to storage in water, substrate water volume, osmotic potential and temperature and light regimes. The seeds are flattened and seedlings are phaneroepigeal with leafy cotyledons. Seeds stored in water kept viable for up to 6 mo, but germination and seedling emergence were reduced after 4 mo. Germination was not affected under water-logged conditions, but seedling emergence was reduced at the water volume corresponding to a water column two times deeper than the seeds' mean thickness (70 ml). When seeds were osmotically stressed, a reduction in the rate and ger- mination percentage occurred at -0.2 MPa and germination was drastically inhibited at-0.6 MPa. Seeds germinated in a wide range of temperatures (15-40 °C), with optimum at continuous temperatures of 25 and 30 °C. Light was not required for germination, and no dormancy mechanisms were observed. The seed and seedling morphology and the germinative responses of the species may permit its regeneration in periodically flooded lowland forests and riparian habitats and are probably key factors in explaining the species' wide distribution.},

abstract = {Adverse environmental conditions constrain active flight and thereby limit reproduction in most insects. Butterflies have evolved various adaptations in order to thermoregulate, allowing females to search for nectar and to oviposit under unfavorable ther- mal conditions. We studied experimentally and with observational data the effect of low ambient temperatures experienced in the morn- ing on the timing of oviposition and clutch size in the Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia). Comparisons were madebetween individuals with different forms of the gene Pgi, encoding the gly- colytic enzyme phosphoglucose isomerase, since naturally segregating variation at Pgi is known to be correlated with flight metabolic rate, flight performance, and fecundity. Experiencing low temperature in the morning delayed the initiation of oviposition and decreased clutch size.We used a thermal image camera to measure the thoracic surface temperature of butterflies immediately after voluntary flight. Single nucleotide polymorphism at Pgi was associated with thoracic temperature at low ambient temperatures. This has consequences for reproduction because females that are able to fly at lower ambient temperatures generally initiate oviposition earlier in the afternoon, when the environmental conditions are most favorable and the av- erage egg clutch size is generally largest. These results suggest that variation in physiological and molecular capacity to sustain active flight at low ambient temperature has significant fitness-related con- sequences in insects.},

We used a field N-fertilization$\backslash$nexperiment in lower and upper elevation tropical rain forests in$\backslash$nPuerto Rico to explore the responses of above- and belowground C$\backslash$npools to N addition.

In contrast, soil C concentrations increased$\backslash$nsignificantly with N fertilization in both forests, leading to larger$\backslash$nC stocks in fertilized plots. However, different soil C pools responded$\backslash$nto N fertilization differently. Labile (low density) soil C fractions$\backslash$nand live fine roots declined with fertilization, while mineral-associated$\backslash$nsoil C increased in both forests. Decreased soil CO(2) fluxes in$\backslash$nfertilized plots were correlated with smaller labile soil C pools$\backslash$nin the lower elevation forest (R(2) = 0.65, p {\textless} 0.05), and with lower$\backslash$nlive fine root biomass in the upper elevation forest (R(2) = 0.90,$\backslash$np {\textless} 0.05). Our results indicate that soil C storage is sensitive$\backslash$nto N deposition in tropical forests, even where plant productivity$\backslash$nis not N-limited. The mineral-associated soil C pool has the potential$\backslash$nto respond relatively quickly to N additions, and can drive increases$\backslash$nin bulk soil C stocks in tropical forests.},

abstract = {We investigated how soil respiration (Rs), heterotrophic respiration (Rh) and rhizosphere respiration (Rr) respond to nitrogen addition in a 21-yr-old larch (Larix principis-rupprechtii) plantation in North China. Three levels of nitrogen treatments (control, no nitrogen addition; low-N, 20kgNha-1yr-1; high-N, 50kgNha-1yr-1) were established in May 2010. Rs, Rh and Rr were then measured during the growing seasons from 2011 to 2013. Nitrogen addition significantly reduced Rs by 10.0{\%} under low-N treatment and by 12.5{\%} under high-N treatment. Rh and Rr showed different responses to nitrogen addition. Nitrogen addition had no significant effects on growing season fluxes of Rh during the observation periods, but Rr was decreased by {\~{}}37{\%} and {\~{}}31{\%} under the low-N and high-N treatments, respectively. Averaged across the three growing seasons, the mean rate of Rs decreased from 2.47±0.39$\mu$molm-2s-1in the control plots to 2.22±0.34$\mu$molm-2s-1in low-N plot and 2.16±0.30$\mu$molm-2s-1in the high-N plot. Rr contributed about 111{\%} and 76{\%} of the observed reduction of Rs in low and high-N plots, respectively. In addition, elevated nitrogen input also reduced the temperature coefficients (Q10) of Rh and Rr. Compared to the control, nitrogen additions significantly decreased Q10of Rh and Rr in high-N plots by 7{\%} and 13{\%}, respectively. Overall, our results suggest that the reduction in Rs can mainly be attributed to the decrease in rhizosphere respiration in our nitrogen-limited plantation. With global temperature rising, nitrogen deposition may increase carbon sequestration in forest ecosystems, not only by reducing carbon loss by Rs, but also by reducing the temperature coefficients of Rh and Rr. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Juvenile hormone (JH) plays key roles in controlling insect growth and metamorphosis. However, relatively little is known about the JH signaling pathways. Until recent years, increasing evidence has suggested that JH modulates the action of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E) by regulating expression of broad (br), a 20E early response gene, through Met/Gce and Kr-h1. To identify other genes involved in JH signaling, we designed a novel Drosophila genetic screen to isolate mutations that derepress JH-mediated br suppression at early larval stages. We found that mutations in three Wnt signaling negative regulators in Drosophila, Axin (Axn), supernumerary limbs (slmb), and naked cuticle (nkd), caused precocious br expression, which could not be blocked by exogenous JHA. A similar phenotype was observed when armadillo (arm), the mediator of Wnt signaling, was overexpressed. qRT-PCR revealed that Met, gce and Kr-h1expression was suppressed in the Axn, slmb and nkd mutants as well as in arm gain-of-function larvae. Furthermore, ectopic expression of gce restored Kr-h1 expression but not Met expression in the arm gain-of-function larvae. Taken together, we conclude that Wnt signaling cross-talks with JH signaling by suppressing transcription of Met and gce, genes that encode for putative JH receptors. The reduced JH activity further induces down-regulation of Kr-h1expression and eventually derepresses br expression in the Drosophila early larval stages.},

abstract = {An ecological community's species diversity tends to erode through time as a result of stochastic extinction, competitive exclusion, and unstable host-enemy dynamics. This erosion of diversity can be prevented over the short term if recruits are highly diverse as a result of preferential recruitment of rare species or, alternatively, if rare species survive preferentially, which increases diversity as the ages of the individuals increase. Here, we present census data from seven New and Old World tropical forest dynamics plots that all show the latter pattern. Within local areas, the trees that survived were as a group more diverse than those that were recruited or those that died. The larger (and therefore on average older) survivors were more diverse within local areas than the smaller survivors. When species were rare in a local area, they had a higher survival rate than when they were common, resulting in enrichment for rare species and increasing diversity with age and size class in these complex ecosystems.},

abstract = {Tropical forests contain large reserves of carbon that are vulnerable to perturbation linked to human activities, including deforestation and climate change. Accurate estimates of forest carbon are therefore required urgently to support efforts to conserve tropical forests. We quantified carbon stocks in primary and 60-year-old secondary forest plots located on infertile Ultisols in Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, one of the few remaining areas of forest in Singapore. We used tree census data for 24.2ha of primary forest and 23ha of secondary forest, together with allometric equations, to estimate aboveground and coarse root biomass. Coarse woody debris stocks were censused along 2.44km and 2.12km of transects in primary and secondary forest, respectively. Soil carbon and fine root carbon stocks were assessed from soil samples taken to 3m depth in a 2-ha secondary forest plot and a 2-ha primary forest plot, combined with bulk density measured in a nearby soil profile pit. Total estimated carbon stock in the primary forest, which was located on the hilltop and upper slopes (80-115m elevation), was 337MgCha-1, of which 50{\%} was aboveground biomass, 33{\%} in soil, 12{\%} in coarse roots, 4.6{\%} in coarse woody debris, and 0.8{\%} in fine roots. In the secondary forest, located on lower slopes and valley (50-85m elevation), the total carbon stock was 274MgCha-1 and the relative importance of aboveground biomass and soil were reversed, with 38{\%} in aboveground biomass, 52{\%} in soil, 6.9{\%} in coarse roots, 1.5{\%} in coarse woody debris, and 1.3{\%} in fine roots. Including carbon in deep subsoil (i.e. to 3m) increased soil carbon stocks by ∼40{\%} compared to 1m depth. Overall, the 60-year-old secondary forest contained 60{\%} as much biomass as the primary forest, while the primary forest had lower carbon stocks than other primary forests in the region. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We present preliminary inventories of plants, butterflies, and day-flying moths of the Reserva Ecol{\'{o}}gica Leonelo Oviedo (RELO), a small Premontane Moist Forest preserve within the University of Costa Rica campus, located in the urbanized part of the Valley. Butterflies are one of the best bio-indicators of a habitat's health, because they are highly sensitive to environmental changes and are tightly linked to the local flora. A description of the RELO's physical features and its history is also presented with illustrations. Approximately 432 species of ca. 334 genera in 113 families of plants were identified. However, only 57 {\%} of them represent species native to the Premontane Moist Forest of the region; the rest are either exotic or species introduced mostly from lowland. More than 200 species of butterflies in six families, including Hesperiidae, have been recorded.},

abstract = {Information on net primary production in tropical forests is needed for the development of realistic global carbon budgets, for projecting how these ecosystems will be affected by climatic and atmospheric changes, and for evaluating eddy covariance measurements of tropical forest carbon flux. However, a review of the database commonly used to address these issues shows that it has serious flaws. In this paper we synthesize the data in the primary literature on NPP in old-growth tropical forests to produce a consistent data set on NPP for these forests. Studies in this biome have addressed only a few NPP components, all aboveground. Given the limited scope of the direct field measurements, we sought relationships in the existing data that allow estimation of unmeasured aspects of production from those that are more easily assessed. We found a predictive relationship between annual litterfall and aboveground biomass increment. For 39 diverse tropical forest sites, we then developed consistent, documented estimates of the upper and lower bounds around total NPP to serve as benchmarks for calibrating and validating biogeochemical models with respect to this biome. We developed these estimates based on existing field measurements, current understanding of aboveground consumption and biogenic volatile organic carbon emissions, and our judgment that belowground production is bounded by the range 0.2-1.2 x ANPP (aboveground NPP). Across this broad spectrum of tropical forests (dry to wet, lowland to montane, nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor soils), our estimates of lower and upper bounds on total NPP range from 1.7 to 11.8 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) (lower bounds) and from 3.1 to 21.7 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1) (upper bounds). We also showed that two relationships that have been used for estimating NPP (the Bray-Gorham relationship based on leaf litterfall and the Miami model based on temperature or precipitation) are not valid for the tropical forest biome.},

Balanus amphitrite, is a shallow water acorn barnacle capable of inhabiting expanses from supralittoral to subtidal levels, and as an epibiont. Its potential to survive and successfully establish local population is endorsed by various physiological adaptations and larval sensory perceptions. The larval life cycle of this species has both planktrotrophic naupliar and non-feeding cyprid stages. The naupliar energetics has a bearing on the capabilities of cypris larvae to explore surfaces for settlement and also the recruitment success of juveniles. The most complete nervous system in the barnacles is established in the cypris larva. Although there has been considerable research with reference to their settlement and metamorphosis, not much is known about the olfactory, photo and auditory sensory mechanisms with respect to settlement and metamorphosis, which need further attention. Understanding the response of most sensitive life stages of barnacles to environmental changes in intertidal habitats can also serve as important models for understanding the effect of climate change on species distribution.},

abstract = {Terrestrial biosphere-atmosphere carbon dioxide (CO(2)) exchange is dominated by tropical forests, where photosynthetic carbon (C) uptake is thought to be phosphorus (P)-limited. In P-poor tropical forests, P may also limit organic matter decomposition and soil C losses. We conducted a field-fertilization experiment to show that P fertilization stimulates soil respiration in a lowland tropical rain forest in Costa Rica. In the early wet season, when soluble organic matter inputs to soil are high, P fertilization drove large increases in soil respiration. Although the P-stimulated increase in soil respiration was largely confined to the dry-to-wet season transition, the seasonal increase was sufficient to drive an 18{\%} annual increase in CO(2) efflux from the P-fertilized plots. Nitrogen (N) fertilization caused similar responses, and the net increases in soil respiration in response to the additions of N and P approached annual soil C fluxes in mid-latitude forests. Human activities are altering natural patterns of tropical soil N and P availability by land conversion and enhanced atmospheric deposition. Although our data suggest that the mechanisms driving the observed respiratory responses to increased N and P may be different, the large CO(2) losses stimulated by N and P fertilization suggest that knowledge of such patterns and their effects on soil CO(2) efflux is critical for understanding the role of tropical forests in a rapidly changing global C cycle.},

abstract = {Tropical forest restoration strategies have the potential to accelerate the recovery of the nutrient cycles in degraded lands. Litter production and its decomposition represent the main transfer of organic material and nutrients into the soil substrate. We evaluated litter production, accumulation on the forest floor, and its decomposition under three restoration strategies: plantation (entire area planted with trees), island (trees planted in patches of three different sizes) and control (natural regeneration) plots. We also compared restoration strategies to young secondary forest (7-9yr). Restoration treatments were established in 50x50m plots in June 2004 at six sites in Southern Costa Rica. Planted tree species included two native timber species (Terminalia amazonia and Vochysia guatemalensis) interplanted with two N fixers (Erythrina poep- pigiana and Inga edulis). Litter was collected every 15 days between September 2008 and August 2009 in 12 0.25m2 litter traps distributed within each plot; litter that accumulated on the soil surface was collected at four locations (0.25m2 quadrats) within each plot in February and May 2009. Total litter production in plantation (6.3Mg/ha) and secondary forest (7.3Mg/ha) did not differ, but were greater than in islands (3.5Mg/ha) and con- trol (1.4Mg/ha). Plantation had greatest accumulation of litter on the soil surface (10.6Mg/ha) as compared to the other treatments (SF=7.2; I=6.7; C=4.9). Secondary forest was the only treatment with a greater annual produc- tion of litter than litter accumulation on the soil surface. Carbon storage in litter was similar between plantation and secondary forest, and significantly greater than the other treatments. No differences were found for carbon concentration and storage in the soil among treatments. There was also high variability in the production and accumulation of litter and carbon among sites. Active restoration treatments accelerated the production of litter and carbon storage in comparison to areas under natural recovery. However, the nutrient cycle has not necessar- ily been restored under these conditions, as high litter accumulation on the soil surface indicates a low decompo- sition rate, which slows nutrient return to the soil.},

abstract = {Soil respiration rates vary significantly among major plant biomes, suggesting that vegetation type influences the rate of soil respiration. However, correlations among climatic factors, vegetation distributions, and soil respiration rates make cause-effect arguments difficult. Vegetation may affect soil respiration by influencing soil microclimate and structure, the quantity of detritus supplied to the soil, the quality of that detritus, and the overall rate of root respiration. At the global scale, soil respiration rates correlate positively with litterfall rates in forests, as previously reported, and with aboveground net primary productivity in grasslands, providing evidence of the importance of detritus supply. To determine the direction and magnitude of the effect of vegetation type on soil respiration, we collated data from published studies where soil respiration rates were measured simultaneously in two or more plant communities. We found no predictable differences in soil respiration between cropped and vegetation-free soils, between forested and cropped soils, or between grassland and cropped soils, possibly due to the diversity of crops and cropping systems included. Factors such as temperature, moisture availability, and substrate properties that simultaneously influence the production and consumption of organic matter are more important in controlling the overall rate of soil respiration than is vegetation type in most cases. However, coniferous forests had similar to 10{\%} lower rates of soil respiration than did adjacent broad-leaved forests growing on the same soil type, and grasslands had, on average, similar to 20{\%} higher soil respiration rates than did comparable forest stands, demonstrating that vegetation type does in some cases significantly affect rates of soil respiration.

abstract = {We evaluated soil phosphorus (P) fractions, other soil characteristics, and rates of symbiotic N-2 fixation across a substrate-age gradient in Hawaii that was dominated by the leguminous tree Acacia koa (koa). Patterns of soil P observed on this gradient were compared to those on a slightly wetter gradient dominated by the nonfixer Metrosideros polymorpha (ohia). Along both gradients, concentrations of primary-mineral P fell sharply between the young and intermediate-aged sites, while labile inorganic P declined most steeply between the intermediateaged and old sites. The most marked difference between the two gradients was that total soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and P, as well as nonoccluded organic P, were more variable across the ohia gradient, increasing to the intermediate-aged sites, then declining sharply at the old site. On the koa gradient, specific nitrogenase activity, measured by the acetylene-reduction (AR) assay, decreased three- to eightfold between the young site and the intermediate-aged and old sites, respectively. Nodule biomass showed no clear pattern. N, fixation rates, estimated by combining AR activity and nodule biomass measurements, were up to 8 kg N . ha(-1) . y(-1) at the young site and no more than 2 kg N . ha(-1) . y(-1) at the older sites, suggesting that koa may be a modest source of N in these Hawaiian forests.},

abstract = {Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition may constrain soil phosphorus (P) and base cation availability in tropical forests, for which limited evidence have yet been available. In this study, we reported responses of soil inorganic nutrients to full factorial N and P treatments in three tropical forests different in initial soil N status (N-saturated old-growth forest and two less-N-rich younger forests). Responses of microbial biomass, annual litterfall production and nutrient input were also monitored. Results showed that N treatments decreased soil inorganic nutrients (except N) in all three forests, but the underlying mechanisms varied depending on forests: through inhibition on litter decomposition in the old-growth forest and through Al 3+ replacement of Ca2+ in the two younger forests. In contrast, besides great elevation in soil available P, P treatments induced 60{\%}, 50{\%}, 26{\%} increases in sum of exchangeable (K+ +Ca2+ +Mg2+) in the old-growth and the two younger forests, respectively. These positive effects of P were closely related to P-stimulated microbial biomass and litter nutrient input, implying possible stimulation of nutrient return. Our results suggest that N deposition may result in decreases in soil inorganic nutrients (except N) and that P addition can enhance soil inorganic nutrients to support ecosystem processes in these tropical forests.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) deposition is projected to increase significantly in tropical regions in the coming decades, where changes in climate are also expected. Additional N and warming each have the potential to alter soil carbon (C) storage via changes in microbial activity and decomposition, but little is known about the combined effects of these global change factors in tropical ecosystems. In this study, we used controlled laboratory incubations of soils from a long-term N fertilization experiment to explore the sensitivity of soil C to increased N in two N-rich tropical forests. We found that fertilization corresponded to significant increases in bulk soil C concentrations, and decreases in C loss via heterotrophic respiration (P {\textless} 0.05). The increase in soil C was not uniform among C pools, however. The active soil C pool decomposed faster with fertilization, while slowly cycling C pools had longer turnover times. These changes in soil C cycling with N additions corresponded to the responses of two groups of microbial extracellular enzymes. Smaller active C pools corresponded to increased hydrolytic enzyme activities; longer turnover times of the slowly cycling C pool corresponded to reduced activity of oxidative enzymes, which degrade more complex C compounds, in fertilized soils. Warming increased soil respiration overall, and N fertilization significantly increased the temperature sensitivity of slowly cycling C pools in both forests. In the lower elevation forest, respired CO(2) from fertilized cores had significantly higher delta 14C values than control soils, indicating losses of relatively older soil C. These results indicate that soil C storage is sensitive to both N deposition and warming in N-rich tropical soils, with interacting effects of these two global change factors. N deposition has the potential to increase total soil C stocks in tropical forests, but the long-term stability of this added C will likely depend on future changes in temperature.},

The pulmonate limpets Siphonaria gigas (Sowerby) and Siphonaria maura (Sowerby) were more abundant in the mid-high- and high-intertidal zone, whereas the keyhole limpet Fissurella virescens (Sowerby) was more abundant in the mid zone. Coiled gastropods were found in the mid- and mid-high-intertidal zone but were absent or scarce in the high zone. Barnacles and coralline algae were found throughout the intertidal zone and foliose algae were mostly present in the splash zone. Abundance of all species changed over the 2-yr period of the study. S. gigas and S. maura and the barnacle Chthamalusfisus Darwin exhibited well-defined fluctuations in density related to recruitment. No recruitment was observed for F. tirescens or Tetraclitapanamensis Pilsbry and populations of both species declined. Changes also occurred for coiled gastropods and were probably related to movement of adults. Coralline and foliose algae were more abundant during the rainy season than during the dry months. Far from being constant, populations on these tropical shores were highly dynamic with temporal changes rivaling those in the temperate zone.},

abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is rapidly increasing in tropical regions. We studied the response of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux to long-term experimental N addition (125 kg N ha-1 yr-1) in mature lowland and montane forests in Panama. In the lowland forest, on soils with high nutrient-supplying and buffering capacity, fine litterfall and stem-growth were neither N- nor phosphorus-limited. In the montane forest, on soils with low nutrient supplying capacity and an organic layer, fine litterfall and stem-growth were N-limited. Our objectives were to 1) explore the influence of soil temperature and moisture on the dynamics of soil CO2 efflux and 2) determine the responses of soil CO2 efflux from an N-rich and N-limited forest to elevated N input. Annual soil CO2-C efflux was larger in the lowland (15.44 ± 1.02 Mg C ha-1) than in the montane forest (9.37 ± 0.28 Mg C ha-1). In the lowland forest, soil moisture explained the largest fraction of the variance in soil CO 2 efflux while soil temperature was the main explanatory variable in the montane forest. Soil CO2 efflux in the lowland forest did not differ between the control and 9-11 yr N-addition plots, suggesting that chronic N input to nutrient-rich tropical lowland forests on well-buffered soils may not change their C balance on a decadal time scale. In the montane forest, first year N addition did not affect soil CO2 efflux but annual CO 2 efflux was reduced by 14{\%} and 8{\%} in the 2nd and 3rd year N-addition plots, respectively, compared to the control. This reduction was caused by a decrease in soil CO2 efflux during the high stem-growth period of the year, suggesting a shift in carbon partitioning from below- to aboveground in the N-addition plots in which stem diameter growth was promoted.},

abstract = {Nutrient availability is widely considered to constrain primary productivity in lowland tropical forests, yet there is little comparable information for the soil microbial biomass. We assessed microbial nutrient limitation by quantifying soil microbial biomass and hydrolytic enzyme activities in a long-term nutrient addition experiment in lowland tropical rain forest in central Panama. Multiple measurements were made over an annual cycle in plots that had received a decade of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrient addition. Phosphorus addition increased soil microbial carbon (13 {\%}), nitrogen (21 {\%}), and phosphorus (49 {\%}), decreased phosphatase activity by {\~{}}65 {\%} and N-acetyl $\beta$-glucosaminidase activity by 24 {\%}, but did not affect $\beta$-glucosidase activity. In contrast, addition of nitrogen, potassium, or micronutrients did not significantly affect microbial biomass or the activity of any enzyme. Microbial nutrients and hydrolytic enzyme activities all declined markedly in the dry season, with the change in microbial biomass equivalent to or greater than the annual nutrient flux in fine litter fall. Although multiple nutrients limit tree productivity at this site, we conclude that phosphorus limits microbial biomass in this strongly-weathered lowland tropical forest soil. This finding indicates that efforts to include enzymes in biogeochemical models must account for the disproportionate microbial investment in phosphorus acquisition in strongly-weathered soils.},

abstract = {We discuss the dynamics of plant litter, the effects of litter on the chemical and physical environment, the direct and indirect effects of plant litter on plant popu- lations and communities, and different adaptative traits that may be related to litter accumulation. The production of litter depends primarily on the site productivity, but other properties of the environment, as well as chance, may introduce important variation. The existence of time lags between the production of plant organs and their transformation into litter appears as a relevant character of litter dynamics seldom included in models. Herbivory, and other processes that destroy biomass or reduce productivity, may reduce the amount of litter produced. The destruction of litter encompasses a complex of interactions. The main processes, including physical and chemical degradation, consumption by invertebrates and decomposition, are differentially affected by the environment and by the physical and chemical char- acteristics of the litter itself. The relative importance of those processes varies among systems. Litter alters the physical and chemical environment directly and indirectly. The decomposition of litter may release both nutrients and phytotoxic substances into the soil. The physical changes produced by litter also alter the activity of decomposers, resulting in an indirect effect on the chemical environment. The accumulated litter intercepts light, shading seeds and seedlings, and reduces the thermal amplitude in the soil. By reducing maximum soil temperatures, and creating a barrier to water vapor diffusion, litter reduces evaporation from the soil. However, litter may also diminish water availability when it retains a large proportion of rainfall. Litter creates a physical barrier for seedling and sprout emergence and to seeds reaching the soil. The heterogeneity introduced into the abiotic environment by the patchy accu- mulation of litter may affect community structure. This effect may be both direct (when the litter of one species affects the performance of a second species) or indirect (when litter produced by one species alters the outcome of the interaction between a second and a third species). Litter tolerance, timing of litterfall to optimize external nutrient recycling, and accumulation of litter to deter competitors (either through physical or chemical effects) have been postulated as strategies associated with litter accumulation. The existing evidence shows that only tolerance to litter accumulation admits adaptative value as the most likely explanation.},

abstract = {Latex is the milky sap that is found in many different plants. It is produced by specialized cells known as laticifers and can comprise a mixture of proteins, carbohydrates, oils, secondary metabolites, and rubber that may help to prevent herbivory and protect wound sites against infection. The wound-induced browning of latex suggests that it contains one or more phenol-oxidizing enzymes. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the major latex proteins from two dandelion species, Taraxacum officinale and Taraxacum kok-saghyz, and enzymatic studies showing that polyphenoloxidase (PPO) is responsible for latex browning. Electrophoretic analysis and amino-terminal sequencing of the most abundant proteins in the aqueous latex fraction revealed the presence of three PPO-related proteins generated by the proteolytic cleavage of a single precursor (pre-PPO). The laticifer-specific pre-PPO protein contains a transit peptide that can target reporter proteins into chloroplasts when constitutively expressed in dandelion protoplasts, perhaps indicating the presence of structures similar to plastids in laticifers, which lack genuine chloroplasts. Silencing the PPO gene by constitutive RNA interference in transgenic plants reduced PPO activity compared with wild-type controls, allowing T. kok-saghyz RNA interference lines to expel four to five times more latex than controls. Latex fluidity analysis in silenced plants showed a strong correlation between residual PPO activity and the coagulation rate, indicating that laticifer-specific PPO plays a major role in latex coagulation and wound sealing in dandelions. In contrast, very little PPO activity is found in the latex of the rubber tree Hevea brasiliensis, suggesting functional divergence of latex proteins during plant evolution.},

abstract = {This review assesses the degree of resilience of mangrove forests to large, infrequent disturbance (tsunamis) and their role in coastal protection, and to chronic disturbance events (climate change) and the future of mangroves in the face of global change. From a geological perspective, mangroves come and go at considerable speed with the current distribution of forests a legacy of the Holocene, having undergone almost chronic disturbance as a result of fluctuations in sea-level. Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution. This notion is supported by evidence that soil accretion rates in mangrove forests are currently keeping pace with mean sea-level rise. Further support for their resilience comes from patterns of recovery from natural disturbances (storms, hurricanes) which coupled with key life history traits, suggest pioneer-phase characteristics. Stand composition and forest structure are the result of a complex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive interactions leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession sequences, in response to physical/chemical gradients and landform changes. The extent to which some or all of these factors come into play depends on the frequency, intensity, size, and duration of the disturbance. Mangroves do offer some protection from catastrophic disturbance such as tsunamis; some hydrological models suggest 90{\%} reduction in tsunami wave flow pressure for a 100-m wide forest belt. The magnitude of energy absorption strongly depends on tree density, stem and root diameter, shore slope, bathymetry, spectral characteristics of incident waves, and tidal stage upon entering the forest. The ultimate disturbance, climate change, may lead to a maximum global loss of 10-15{\%} of mangrove forest, but must be considered of secondary importance compared with current average annual rates of 1-2{\%} deforestation. A large reservoir of below-ground nutrients, rapid rates of nutrient flux and microbial decomposition, complex and highly efficient biotic controls, self-design and redundancy of keystone species, and numerous feedbacks, all contribute to mangrove resilience to various types of disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Ex situ biodegradation of Mangifera indica L, Artocarpus heterophyllus.Lamk. and Anacardium occidentale L. leaf litter were examined in the warm humid tropics of southern Kerala adopting the standard litter bag technique. The time taken for the decay varied with the species and it followed the order MangiferaOArtocarpusOAnacardium. Weight loss accorded a linear decline and was better correlated with soil moisture than temperature. The half-life values were 3.2, 3.4 and 4.0 months for Anacardium, Artocarpus and Mangifera, respectively. Soil faunal and floral activities were monitored during the decay and the earthworms, fungi and bacteria proved the chief degraders of the intact litter. Actinomycetes were active during the final stages. The variations in decay rates of the three species are attributed to the differences in the litter quality and activity of the decomposer organisms in soil. NPK dynamics revealed temporary phases of immobilization for nitrogen and phosphorus before final release, while potassium recorded a continuous release. Decomposition apparently improved the available NPK status of soil, potassium being liable to leaching was soon lost from the surface soil.},

abstract = {This study explored biotic and abiotic causes for spatio-temporal variation in soil respiration from surface litter, roots, and soil organic matter over one year at four rain forest sites with different vegetation structures and soil types in the eastern Amazon, Brazil. Estimated mean annual soil respiration varied between 13-17 t C ha-1 yr-1, which was partitioned into 0-2 t C ha-1 yr-1 from litter, 6-9 t C ha-1 yr-1 from roots, and 5-6 t C ha-1 yr-1 from soil organic matter. Litter contribution showed no clear seasonal change, though experimental precipitation exclusion over a one-hectare area was associated with a ten-fold reduction in litter respiration relative to unmodified sites. The estimated mean contribution of soil organic matter respiration fell, from 49{\%} during the wet season to 32{\%} in the dry season, while root respiration contribution increased from 42{\%} in the wet season to 61{\%} during the dry season. Spatial variation in respiration from soil, litter, roots, and soil organic matter was not explained by volumetric soil moisture or temperature. Instead, spatial heterogeneity in litter and root mass accounted for 44{\%} of observed spatial variation in soil respiration (p {\textless} 0.001). In particular, variation in litter respiration per unit mass and root mass accounted for much of the observed variation in respiration from litter and roots, respectively, and hence total soil respiration. This information about patterns of, and underlying controls on, respiration from different soil components should assist attempts to accurately model soil carbon dioxide fluxes over space and time.

abstract = {Symbiotic di-nitrogen (N-2) fixation is a critical biogeochemical process in tropical forests, yet it remains unresolved how fixation is controlled by the availability of soil nitrogen and phosphorus, two nutrients often considered limiting in terrestrial ecosystems. We examine whether individual N-2-fixing trees can overcome nitrogen and phosphorus constraints by employing different strategies of nutrient acquisition and use: N-2 fixation, phosphatase exudation, mycorrhizal symbiosis and changes in root-shoot ratio or tissue stoichiometry. We grew a common and widespread N-2 fixer, Inga punctata, in a full factorial nitrogen and phosphorus addition experiment (each nutrient at three levels) and evaluated whether trees adjusted their strategies of nutrient acquisition to overcome limitation. N-2 fixation was controlled by nitrogen availability in phosphorus-sufficient soils, but both fixation and plant growth were constrained by phosphorus in the unamended native phosphorus-poor soils. Despite the investment in both extracellular phosphatases and mycorrhizal symbionts, plants were unable to overcome phosphorus limitation. Our findings support the hypotheses that: (i) N-2 fixation is proximately controlled by nitrogen availability, consistent with a facultative fixation strategy, and (ii) N-2 fixation and N-2 fixer biomass growth are ultimately constrained by soil phosphorus. We found no support for the hypothesis that fixers can overcome phosphorus limitation by trading fixed N-2 for soil phosphorus. Synthesis. This study provides new knowledge about how nitrogen and phosphorus interact to regulate tropical N-2 fixation by examining a suite of strategies that plants may employ to overcome nutrient limitation. These findings, focused at the organismal level, have broader implications for biogeochemical controls at the ecosystem level in tropical forests.},

@article{ORiordan2010,
abstract = {This paper reviews what is known about the factors affecting the distribution of barnacle species of the genus Chthamalus Ranzani at global, regional, local and microhabitat spatial scales. The genus is almost worldwide in distribution, on tropical and temperate shores, with currently over twenty recognised species. The majority of members of this genus commonly occur in the middle and upper intertidal. At the global scale (1000s km), the four currently recognised informal groups of Chthamalus exhibit a regional endemicity that has probably resulted from tectonic events during the last 70-90 Ma. The 'challengeri' and 'fissus' groups are thought to be the most ancestral within Chthamalus. Their extant distributions derive from the late Cretaceous. The 'malayensis' and 'stellatus' groups are assumed to be more derived and are probably sister taxa. The latter two groups exhibit overlap with the apparently more ancient 'challengeri' and 'fissus' groups. Abiotic factors (e.g. temperature, desiccation, aspect, winds and fetch) together with biotic factors (e.g. supply-side) all affect the distribution of Chthamalus species at regional (100s km) and local (1-10s km) scales. The relationship between these factors and Chthamalus distributions has best been studied in the north-east Atlantic species C. stellatus and C. montagui and to a lesser extent in the western Atlantic species C. fragilis. Microhabitat (within shore) patterns of distribution in Chthamalus barnacles are controlled by biotic (e.g. supply-side, competition, predation and grazer/algal interactions) and abiotic (e.g. shading and run-off) factors. The highly fluctuating temperatures and desiccation stress that Chthamalus species experience when aerially exposed at low tide appear to have a major deterministic effect on species distributions, often limiting the vertical distribution of Chthamalus species on the shore. On sheltered shores, the abiotic stress due to minimal wave splash may be more important than biotic factors, while on moderately exposed and exposed shores, that can be supplied with many propagules and where density-dependent factors come into play, biotic factors may be more important. Abiotic factors may also scale up to explain large scale patterns of distribution, such as trends in Chthamalus abundance between NE and SE Atlantic coasts.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Analyses relating long-term records of tree growth to interannual climatic variation at La Selva, Costa Rica have revealed marked forest sensitivities to both temperature and dry-season intensity (Clark et al. 2010). The tropical-forest biome is certain to become warmer, and many areas may become drier. Testing the generality of the La Selva findings with similar analyses of field data from diverse forests across the biome will be a valuable next step. Based on our experiences during the La Selva studies, we propose that such assessments will need to address three issues. One is the number of repeat forest measurements. Short series of re-censuses can be an unreliable basis for assessing climatic sensitivities. For some key climatic factors (e.g., temperature), records consisting of fewer than 10G{\c{C}}{\^{o}}12 re-censuses can span limited climatic ranges, producing erratic and largely nonsignificant correlations. Multiyear census intervals exacerbate these data limitations. Second, different types of forest-growth data call for different analysis approaches. Cohort and tree-ring records need to be adjusted for ontogenetic growth changes, while stand-level data require taking into account potentially confounding influences from forest compositional changes, as from succession. Third, a reliable meteorological record is critical. Poor-quality or internally inconsistent climatic records can fatally corrupt assessments of forest sensitivities. To be usable in such analyses, the meteorological record requires data quality control, gap filling, and adjustments to maintain the record's internal consistency in the face of commonly occurring methods changes (instruments, siting). We illustrate these issues using analyses of the long-term La Selva records. Abstract in Spanish is available at http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/loi/btp},

abstract = {The adaptive radiation of four taxa of gall-inducing insects is compared: sawflies (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), oak gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae), aphids (Homoptera: Aphididae), and gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). The sawflies, with only three genera but many species per genus, colonized many adaptive zones. Many sibling species have been recently recognized. Such characteristics suggest a dynamic evolutionary state of radiation. Innovations in the substrates used for oviposition by sawflies, probably involving ovipositional accidents, have enabled evolution from free-feeding ancestors into diverse gall types and galling sites - from leaf edge to leaf lamina, leaf midrib, petiole, bud, and stem. Host shifting among species of willows (Salix) has been extensive and opportunistic. The oak gall wasps, like the sawflies, colonized many adaptive zones, in terms of galling sites on the plant and diverse gall types. The gall wasps include large genera, and use a geographically widespread host-plant genus rich in species, with largely opportunistic colonization of new hosts. The gall-inducing aphids on Pistacia in Israel show radiation into many adaptive zones, with different gall types and galling sites on the host plant, even though the radiation is much less extensive than in sawflies and gall wasps. A major limiting factor in this smaller radiation appears to be the low richness of Pistacia species and the host specificity of the galling aphids to this plant genus. The gall midges are similar to the sawflies and gall wasps with many large genera. Their radiation is much greater than in the related fungus-feeding midges, indicating the importance of a rich host flora for insect radiation. The study of adaptive radiation in gall-inducing insect taxa offers many opportunities for comparative studies in evolutionary biology. {\textcopyright} 2005 Gesellschaft f{\"{u}}r {\"{O}}kologie.

abstract = {Our objectives were to quantify and compare soil CO2 efflux of two dominant soil types in an old-growth neotropical rain forest in the Atlantic zone of Costa Rica, and to evaluate the control of environmental factors on CO2 release. We measured soil CO2 efflux from eight permanent soil cham- bers on six Oxisol sites. Three sites were developed on old river terraces (‘old alluvium') and the other three were developed on old lava flows (‘residual'). At the same time we measured soil CO2 concen- trations, soil water content and soil temperature at various depths in 6 soil shafts (3 m deep). Between ‘old alluvium' sites, the two-year average CO2 flux rates ranged from 117.3 to 128.9 mg C m−2 h−1 . Significantly higher soil CO2 flux occurred on the ‘residual' sites (141.1 to 184.2 mg C m−2 h−1 ). Spa- tial differences in CO2 efflux were related to fine root biomass, soil carbon and phosphorus concentra- tion but also to soil water content. Spatial variability in CO2 storage was high and the amount of CO2 stored in the upper and lower soil profile was different between ‘old alluvial' and ‘residual' sites. The major factor identified for explaining temporal variations in soil CO2 efflux was soil water content. Dur- ing periods of high soil water content CO2 emission decreased, probably due to lower diffusion and CO2 production rates. During the 2-year study period inter-annual variation in soil CO2 efflux was not detected.},

abstract = {Melastomataceae are among the most abundant and diversified groups of plants throughout the tropics, but their intrafamily rela- tionships and morphological evolution are poorly understood. Here we report the results of parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses of cpDNA sequences from the rbcL and ndchF genes and the rplI6 intron, generated for eight outgroups (Crypteroniaceae, Alzateaceae, Rhynchocalycaceae, Oliniaceae, Penaeaceae, Myrtaceae, and Onagraceae) and 54 species of melastomes. The sample represents 42 of the family's curTently recognized -150 genera, the 13 traditional tribes, and the three subfamilies, Astronioideae, Melastomatoideae, and Memecyloideae (= Memecylaceae DC.). Parsimony and ML yield congruent topologies that place Memecy- laceae as sister to Melastomataceae. Pternandra, a Southeast Asian genus of 15 species of which five were sampled, is the first- branching Melastomataceae. This placement has low bootstrap support (72{\%}), but agrees with morphological treatments that placed Pternandra in Melastomatacaeae because of its acrodromal leaf venation, usually ranked as a tribe or subfamily. The interxylary phloem islands found in Memecylaceae and Pternandra, but not most other Melastomataceae, likely evolved in parallel because Pternandra resembles Melastomataceae in its other wood characters. A newly discovered plesiomorphic character in Pternandra, also present in Memecylaceae, is a fibrous anther endothecium. Higher Melastomataceae lack an endothecium as do the closest relatives of Melastomataceae and Memecylaceae. The next deepest split is between Astronieae, with anthers opening by slits, and all remaining Melastomataceae, which have anthers opening by pores. Within the latter; several generic groups, corresponding to traditional tribes, receive solid statistical support, but relationships among them, with one exception, are different from anything predicted on the basis of morphological data. Thus, Miconieae and Merianieae are sister groups, and both are sister to a trichotomy of Bertolonieae, Mi- crolicieae + Melastomeae, and Dissochaeteae + Blakeeae. Sonerileae/Oxysporeae are nested within Dissochaeteae, Rhexieae within Melastomeae, and African and Asian Melastomeae within neotropical Melastomeae. These findings have profound implications for our understanding of melastome morphological evolution (and biogeography), implying, for example, that berries evolved from capsules minimally four times, stamen connectives went from dorsally enlarged to basal/ventrally enlarged, and loss of an endothecium preceded poricidal dehiscence.},

Our aim is to overcome these challenges using different microbial combinations in mining-impacted soil and focus on their physiological and biochemical impacts on a model plant system, which has multiple applications. In the current study, sorghum BTx623 seedlings grown in mining-impacted soil in greenhouse were subjected to plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB or B) alone, PGPB with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (My), My alone and control group with no treatment. Root biomass and uptake of most of the elements showed significant increase in all treatment groups in comparison with control. Mycorrhiza group showed the best effect followed by My + B and B groups for uptake of majority of the elements by roots. On the contrary, biomass of both shoot and root was more influenced by B treatment than My + B and My treatments. Metabolomics identified compounds whose levels changed in roots of treatment groups significantly in comparison to control. Upregulation of stearic acid, sorbitol, sebacic acid and ferulic acid correlated positively with biomass and uptake of almost all elements. Two biochemical pathways, fatty acid biosynthesis and galactose metabolism, were regulated in all treatment groups. Three common pathways were upregulated only in My and My + B groups. Our results suggest that PGPB enhanced metabolic activities which resulted in increase in element uptake and sorghum root biomass whether accompanied with mycorrhiza or used solely.},

abstract = {Atmospheric changes that may affect physiological and biogeochemical processes in old-growth tropical forests include: (i) rising atmospheric CO2 concentration; (ii) an increase in land surface temperature; (iii) changes in precipitation and ecosystem moisture status; and (iv) altered disturbance regimes. Elevated CO2 is likely to directly influence numerous leaf-level physiological processes, but whether these changes are ultimately reflected in altered ecosystem carbon storage is unclear. The net primary productivity (NPP) response of old-growth tropical forests to elevated CO2 is unknown, but unlikely to exceed the maximum experimentally measured 25{\%} increase in NPP with a doubling of atmospheric CO2 from pre-industrial levels. In addition, evolutionary constraints exhibited by tropical plants adapted to low CO2 levels during most of the Late Pleistocene, may result in little response to increased carbon availability. To set a maximum potential response for a Central Amazon forest, using an individual-tree-based carbon cycling model, a modelling experiment was performed constituting a 25{\%} increase in tree growth rate, linked to the known and expected increase in atmospheric CO2. Results demonstrated a maximum carbon sequestration rate of ca. 0.2 Mg C per hectare per year (ha(-1) yr(-1), where 1 ha = 10(4) m2), and a sequestration rate of only 0.05 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) for an interval centred on calendar years 1980-2020. This low rate results from slow growing trees and the long residence time of carbon in woody tissues. By contrast, changes in disturbance frequency, precipitation patterns and other environmental factors can cause marked and relatively rapid shifts in ecosystem carbon storage. It is our view that observed changes in tropical forest inventory plots over the past few decades is more probably being driven by changes in disturbance or other environmental factors, than by a response to elevated CO2. Whether these observed changes in tropical forests are the beginning of long-term permanent shifts or a transient response is uncertain and remains an important research priority.},

abstract = {Tropical rain forests are known for their high biological diversity, but the effects of plant diversity on important ecosystem processes in this biome remain unclear. Interspecies differences in both the demand for nutrients and in foliar and litter nutrient concentrations could drive variations in both the pool sizes and fluxes of important belowground resources, yet our understanding of the effects and importance of aboveground heterogeneity on belowground biogeochemistry is poor, especially in the species-rich forests of the wet tropics. To investigate the effects of individual tree species on belowground biogeochemical processes, we used both field and laboratory studies to examine how carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) cycles vary under nine different canopy tree species - including three legume and six non-legume species - that vary in foliar nutrient concentrations in a wet tropical forest in southwestern Costa Rica. We found significant differences in belowground C, N and P cycling under different canopy tree species: total C, N and P pools in standing litter varied by species, as did total soil and microbial C and N pools. Rates of soil extracellular acid phosphatase activity also varied significantly among species and functional groups, with higher rates of phosphatase activity under legumes. In addition, across all tree species, phosphatase activity was significantly positively correlated with litter N/P ratios, suggesting a tight coupling between relative N and P inputs and resource allocation to P acquisition. Overall, our results suggest the importance of aboveground plant community composition in promoting belowground biogeochemical heterogeneity at relatively small spatial scales. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Seedling regeneration on forest floors is often impaired by competition with established plants. In some lowland temperate rain forests, tree fern trunks provide safe sites on which tree species establish, and grow large enough to take root in the ground and persist. Here we explore the competitive and facilitative effects of two tree fern species, Cyathea smithii and Dicksonia squarrosa, on the epiphytic regeneration of tree species in nutrient-rich alluvial forests in New Zealand. The difficulties that seedlings have in establishing on vertical tree fern trunks were indicated by the following observations. First, seedling abundance was greatest on the oldest sections of tree fern trunks, near the base, suggesting that trunks gradually recruited more and more seedlings over time, but many sections of trunk were devoid of seedlings, indicating the difficulty of establishment on a vertical surface. Second, most seedlings were from small-seeded species, presumably because smaller seeds can easily lodge on tree fern trunks. Deer browsing damage was observed on 73{\%} of epiphytic seedlings growing within 2 m of the ground, whereas few seedlings above that height were browsed. This suggests that tree ferns provide refugia from introduced deer, and may slow the decline in population size of deer-preferred species. We reasoned that tree ferns would compete with epiphytic seedlings for light, because below the tree fern canopy photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) was about 1{\%} of above-canopy PAR. Frond removal almost tripled {\%}PAR on the forest floor, leading to a significant increase in the height growth rate (HGR) of seedlings planted on the forest floor, but having no effects on the HGRs of epiphytic seedlings. Our study shows evidence of direct facilitative interactions by tree ferns during seedling establishment in plant communities associated with nutrient-rich soils.},

The relation of edaphic differentiation to tradeoffs among leaf functional traits is less clear, but may provide insights into mechanisms of habitat partitioning in these species rich assemblages.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We quantify the leaf economics spectrum (LES) for 16 tree species within a Bornean forest characterized by highly pronounced habitat specialization. Our findings suggest that the primary axis of trait variation in light-limited, lowland tropical forests was identical to the LES and corresponds with the shade tolerance continuum. There was no separation with respect to edaphic variation along this primary axis of trait variation. However, a second orthogonal axis determined largely by foliar P concentrations resulted in a near-perfect separation of species occupying distinct soil types within the forest.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We suggest that this second axis of leaf trait variation represents a "leaf edaphic habitat spectrum" related to foliar P and potentially other nutrients closely linked to geological substrate, and may generally occur in plant communities characterized by strong edaphic resource gradients.},

abstract = {This study investigated the spatial and temporal variation in soil carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux and its relationship with soil temperature, soil moisture and rainfall in a forest near Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. The mean rate of efflux was 6.450.25SElmol CO2m2s1 at 25.60.22SE1C (5 cm depth) ranging from 4.35 to 9.76 lmolCO2m2s1; diel changes in efflux were correlated with soil temperature (r 250.60). However, the efflux response to the diel cycle in temperature was not always a clear exponential function. During period of low soil water content, temperature in deeper layers had a better relationship with CO2 efflux than with the temperature nearer the soil surface. Soil water content may limit CO2 production during the drying-down period that appeared to be an important factor controlling the efflux rate (r 250.39). On the other hand, during the rewetting period microbial activity may be the main controlling factor, which may quickly induce very high rates of efflux. The CO2 flux chamber was adapted to mimic the effects of rainfall on soil CO2 efflux and the results showed that efflux rates reduced 30{\%} immediately after a rainfall event. Measurements of the CO2 concentration gradient in the soil profile showed a buildup in the concentration of CO2 after rain on the top soil. This higher CO2 concentration developed shortly after rainfall when the soil pores in the upper layers were filled with water, which created a barrier for gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere.},

abstract = {Understanding secondary successional processes in Amazonian terrestrial ecosystems is becoming increasingly important as continued deforestation expands the area that has become secondary forest, or at least has been through a recent phase of secondary forest growth. Most Amazonian soils are highly weathered and relatively nutrient poor, but the role of nutrients as a factor determining successional processes is unclear. Soils testing and chronosequence studies have yielded equivocal results regarding the possible role of nutrient limitation. The objective of this paper is to report the first two years' results of a nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization experiment in a 6-yr-old secondary forest growing on an abandoned cattle pasture on a clayey Oxisol. Growth of remnant grasses responded significantly to the N + P treatment, whereas tree biomass increased significantly following N-only and N + P treatments. The plants took up about 10{\%} of the 50 kg P/ha of the first year's application, and recovery in soil fractions could account for the rest. The trees took up about 20{\%} of the 100 kg N/ha of the first year's application. No changes in soil inorganic N, soil microbial biomass N, or litter decomposition rates have been observed so far, but soil faunal abundances increased in fertilized plots relative to the control in the second year of the study. A pulse of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide emissions was measured in the N-treated plots only shortly after the second year's application. Net N mineralization and net nitrification assays demonstrated strong immobilization potential, indicating that much of the N was probably retained in the large soil organic-N pool. Although P availability is low in these soils and may partially limit biomass growth, the most striking result of this study so far is the significant response of tree growth to N fertilization. Repeated fire and other losses of N from degraded pastures may render tree growth N limited in some young Amazonian forests. Changes in species composition and monitoring of long-term effects on biomass accumulation will be addressed as this experiment is continued.},

abstract = {To test whether leaf trait relationships vary with plant size, specific leaf area (SLA), area- and mass-based leaf nutrient contents (Narea and Nmass, Parea and Pmass), and area- and mass-based leaf photosynthetic capacities (Aarea and Amass) of 127 small individuals (woody plants shorter than 2 m) and 47 large trees (taller than 10 m) were measured in a tropical montane rain forest, China. A standardizedmajor axis (SMA) methodwas used to scale the mass-based trait relationships.We found that Amass, Parea, Pmass, and SLAwere higher in the small individuals than in the large trees, but the changes of Aarea, Narea and Nmass leveled off. Trait pairs of NmassAmass, SLAAmass andNmassSLA were positively correlated with slopes incommon, but the y-intercept of SLA  Nmass was higher in the large trees than in the small individuals, indicating large trees had a higher N investment at a given SLA. In the pairs of Nmass  Amass and SLA  Amass, small individuals were shifted upwards along a common slope than large trees, corresponding to their large Amass and SLA. At a given SLA, the upwards shift along a common slope of small individuals does not mean that they have higher photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) than large trees, since a common slope and homogenous elevations of SLA-PNUE were found between them. Trait pairs of PmassAmass and NmassPmass were positively correlated and the slopes differed between small and large trees. The slope of Pmass  Amass was steeper in the large than in the small individuals, suggesting large trees would have a disproportionally larger return with the same increase in Pmass. However, the pattern of slope of Nmass  Pmass was the reverse of that observed for Pmass  Amass, indicating a higher N/P ratio in the large than in the small individuals. At a given SLA, large trees had higher photosynthetic phosphorus use efficiency (PPUE) than small individuals, corresponding to their higher elevation of SLA-PPUE. In conclusion, leaf trait relationships can be modified by plant size but the positive correlations among SLA, Nmass, Pmass and Amass generally remain invariant.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Orobanche minor is a root-holoparasitic angiosperm that attacks a wide range of host species, including a number of commonly cultivated crops. The extent to which genetic divergence among natural populations of O. minor is influenced by host specificity has not been determined previously. Here, the host specificity of natural populations of O. minor is quantified for the first time, and evidence that this species may comprise distinct physiological races is provided.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A tripartite approach was used to examine the physiological basis for the divergence of populations occurring on different hosts: (1) host-parasite interactions were cultivated in rhizotron bioassays in order to quantify the early stages of the infection and establishment processes; (2) using reciprocal-infection experiments, parasite races were cultivated on their natural and alien hosts, and their fitness determined in terms of biomass; and (3) the anatomy of the host-parasite interface was investigated using histochemical techniques, with a view to comparing the infection process on different hosts.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nKEY RESULTS: Races occurring naturally on red clover (Trifolium pratense) and sea carrot (Daucus carota ssp. gummifer) showed distinct patterns of host specificity: parasites cultivated in cross-infection studies showed a higher fitness on their natural hosts, suggesting that races show local adaptation to specific hosts. In addition, histological evidence suggests that clover and carrot roots vary in their responses to infection. Different root anatomy and responses to infection may underpin a physiological basis for host specificity.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: It is speculated that host specificity may isolate races of Orobanche on different hosts, accelerating divergence and ultimately speciation in this genus. The rapid life cycle and broad host range of O. minor make this species an ideal model with which to study the interactions of parasitic plants with their host associates.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. Abstract. Interannual variation of carbon fluxes can be attributed to a number of biotic and abiotic controls that operate at different spatial and temporal scales. Type and frequency of disturbance, forest dynamics, and climate regimes are important sources of variability. Assessing the variability of carbon fluxes from these specific sources can enhance the interpretation of past and current observations. Being able to separate the variability caused by forest dynamics from that induced by climate will also give us the ability to determine if the current observed carbon fluxes are within an expected range or whether the ecosystem is undergoing unexpected change. Sources of interannual variation in ecosystem carbon fluxes from three evergreen ecosystems, a tropical, a temperate coniferous, and a boreal forest, were explored using the simulation model STANDCARB. We identified key processes that introduced variation in annual fluxes, but their relative importance differed among the ecosystems studied. In the tropical site, intrinsic forest dynamics contributed ?30{\%} of the total variation in annual carbon fluxes. In the temperate and boreal sites, where many forest processes occur over longer temporal scales than those at the tropical site, climate controlled more of the variation among annual fluxes. These results suggest that climate-related variability affects the rates of carbon exchange differently among sites. Simulations in which temperature, precipitation, and radiation varied from year to year (based on historical records of climate variation) had less net carbon stores than simulations in which these variables were held constant (based on historical records of monthly average climate), a result caused by the functional relationship between temperature and respiration. This suggests that, under a more variable temperature regime, large respiratory pulses may become more frequent and high enough to cause a reduction in ecosystem carbon stores. Our results also show that the variation of annual carbon fluxes poses an important challenge in our ability to determine whether an ecosystem is a source, a sink, or is neutral in regard to C02 at longer timescales. In simulations where climate change negatively affected ecosystem carbon stores, there was a 20{\%} chance of committing Type II error, even with 20 years of sequential data.},

abstract = {Humid tropical forests are often characterized by large nitrogen (N) pools, and are known to have large potential N losses. Although rarely measured, tropical forests likely maintain considerable bio- logical N fixation (BNF) to balance N losses. We estimated inputs of N via BNF by free-living mi- crobes for two tropical forests in Puerto Rico, and assessed the response to increased N availability using an on-going N fertilization experiment. Nitrogenase activity was measured across forest strata, including the soil, forest floor, mosses, can- opy epiphylls, and lichens using acetylene (C2H2) reduction assays. BNF varied significantly among ecosystem compartments in both forests. Mosses had the highest rates of nitrogenase activity per gram of sample, with 11 ± 6 nmol C2H2 reduced/g dry weight/h (mean ± SE) in a lower elevation forest, and 6 ± 1 nmol C2H2/g/h in an upper elevation forest. We calculated potential N fluxes via BNF to each forest compartment using surveys of standing stocks. Soils and mosses provided the largest potential inputs of N via BNF to these eco- systems. Summing all components, total back- ground BNF inputs were 120 ± 29 lg N/m2/h in the lower elevation forest, and 95 ± 15 lg N/m2/h in the upper elevation forest, with added N signif- icantly suppressing BNF in soils and forest floor. Moisture content was significantly positively cor- related with BNF rates for soils and the forest floor. We conclude that BNF is an active biological pro- cess across forest strata for these tropical forests, and is likely to be sensitive to increases in N deposition in tropical regions.},

We used micropropagated field-grown saplings of 19 Betula pendula genotypes, representing genetic variation in a natural birch population, to examine (1) whether genotype can explain variation in leaf litter decomposition within a local plant population, and (2) whether genotypic variation in litter decomposition is associated with genotypic variation in other plant attributes. We found that a local B. pendula population can have substantial genotypic variation in leaf litter mass loss at the early stages of the decomposition process and that this variation can be associated with genotypic variation in herbivore resistance and leaf concentrations of soluble proteins and total nitrogen (N). Our results are among the first to show that fundamental ecosystem processes can be significantly affected by truly intraspecific genetic variation of a plant species.},

abstract = {Resilience is usually defined as the capacity of an ecosystem to absorb distur- bance without shifting to an alternative state and losing function and services [1–3]. The concept therefore encompasses two separate processes: resistance—the magnitude of disturbance that causes a change in structure—and recovery—the speed of return to the original structure [4,5]—which are fundamentally different but rarely distinguished. Yet, resilience has become a central concept in the manage- ment of natural ecosystems [6,7]. Many current management actions aim to alle- viate local stressors in an effort to increase ecosystem resilience to global climate change [8,9]. Such a management philos- ophy is premised on the belief that eliminating local drivers of ecological change will increase the ability of an ecosystem to resist future climate distur- bances, its ability to recover from such disturbances, or both [2,6]. Measuring resilience is fraught with difficulties [1,3]. Nevertheless, assessing changes in resil- ience as a result of management action is critical because there is general agreement for the existence of a strong link between resilience and sustainability [10]. Success- fully increasing the resilience of natural systems may therefore have important implications for human welfare in the face of global climate change.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a decision tree algorithm to characterize spatial extent and spectral features of invasive plant species (i.e., guava, Madagascar cardamom, and Molucca raspberry) in tropical rainforests by integrating datasets from passive and active remote sensing sensors. The decision tree algorithm is based on a number of input variables including matching score and infeasibility images from Mixture Tuned Matched Filtering (MTMF), land-cover maps, tree height information derived from high resolution stereo imagery, polarimetric feature images, Radar Forest Degradation Index (RFDI), polarimetric and InSAR coherence and phase difference images. Spatial distributions of the study organisms are mapped using pixel-based Winner-Takes-All (WTA) algorithm, object oriented feature extraction, spectral unmix- ing, and compared with the newly developed decision tree approach. Our results show that the InSAR phase difference and PolInSAR HH–VV coherence images of L-band PALSAR data are the most important variables following the MTMF outputs in mapping subcanopy invasive plant species in tropical rainforest. We also show that the three types of invasive plants alone occupy about 17.6{\%} of the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) while mixed forest, shrubland and grassland areas are summed to 11.9{\%} of the reserve. This work presents the first systematic attempt to evaluate forest degradation, habitat quality and inva- sive plant statistics in the BNR, and provides significant insights as to management strategies for the control of invasive plants and conversation in the reserve.},

abstract = {In Amazonian tropical forests, recent studies have reported increases in aboveground biomass and in primary productivity, as well as shifts in plant species composition favouring fast-growing species over slow-growing ones. This pervasive alteration of mature tropical forests was attributed to global environmental change, such as an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, nutrient deposition, temperature, drought frequency, and/or irradiance. We used standardized, repeated measurements of over 2 million trees in ten large (16-52 ha each) forest plots on three continents to evaluate the generality of these findings across tropical forests. Aboveground biomass increased at seven of our ten plots, significantly so at four plots, and showed a large decrease at a single plot. Carbon accumulation pooled across sites was significant (+0.24 MgC ha(-1) y(-1), 95{\%} confidence intervals [0.07, 0.39] MgC ha(-1) y(-1)), but lower than reported previously for Amazonia. At three sites for which we had data for multiple census intervals, we found no concerted increase in biomass gain, in conflict with the increased productivity hypothesis. Over all ten plots, the fastest-growing quartile of species gained biomass (+0.33 [0.09, 0.55] {\%} y(-1)) compared with the tree community as a whole (+0.15 {\%} y(-1)); however, this significant trend was due to a single plot. Biomass of slow-growing species increased significantly when calculated over all plots (+0.21 [0.02, 0.37] {\%} y(-1)), and in half of our plots when calculated individually. Our results do not support the hypothesis that fast-growing species are consistently increasing in dominance in tropical tree communities. Instead, they suggest that our plots may be simultaneously recovering from past disturbances and affected by changes in resource availability. More long-term studies are necessary to clarify the contribution of global change to the functioning of tropical forests.},

abstract = {1. Certain ants have considerable morphological diversity within the workforce, with individuals physically specialized for particular jobs. The ecological conditions that select for this phenomenon are still poorly understood. 2. We use a comparative analysis to address the hypothesis that prey type has selected for greater morphological diversity in the small, monophyletic army ant genus Eciton. These ants are nomadic group-predators and transport loads in the limited space below the body, so bulkier prey types should select for more diverse worker morphology. 3. We show that five Eciton species differ in the presence or absence of a distinct 'submajor caste', the morphological exaggeration of submajors when present, and the allometric scaling of standard workers over a broad size range. Crucially, the presence and morphological exaggeration of submajors is associated with the variety of awkwardly shaped prey types that the species takes, and this caste specializes in prey transport. 4. Our findings support the importance of dietary composition in the evolution of worker morphological diversity in Eciton and demonstrate the utility of our general approach. Future critical tests of this hypothesis are discussed, as well as how our approach can contribute to a broader understanding of the relationship between ecology and the evolution of worker morphological diversity.},

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an important macronutrient in arctic and subarctic tundra and its bioavailability is regulated by the mineralization of organic P. Temperature is likely to be an important control on P bioavailability, although effects may differ across contrasting plant communities with different soil properties. We used an elevational gradient in northern Sweden that included both heath and meadow vegetation types at all elevations to study the effects of temperature, soil P sorption capacity and oxalate-extractable aluminium (Alox) and iron (Feox) on the concentration of different soil P fractions. We hypothesized that the concentration of labile P fractions would decrease with increasing elevation (and thus declining temperature), but would be lower in meadow than in heath, given that N to P ratios in meadow foliage are higher. As expected, labile P in the form of Resin-P declined sharply with elevation for both vegetation types. Meadow soils did not have lower concentrations of Resin-P than heath soils, but they did have 2-fold and 1.5-fold higher concentrations of NaOH-extractable organic P and Residual P, respectively. Further, meadow soils had 3-fold higher concentrations of Alox + Feox and a 20{\%} higher P sorption index than did heath soils. Additionally, Resin-P expressed as a proportion of total soil P for the meadow was on average half that in the heath. Declining Resin-P concentrations with elevation were best explained by an associated 2.5-3.0 °C decline in temperature. In contrast, the lower P availability in meadow relative to heath soils may be associated with impaired organic P mineralization, as indicated by a higher accumulation of organic P and P sorption capacity. Our results indicate that predicted temperature increases in the arctic over the next century may influence P availability and biogeochemistry, with consequences for key ecosystem processes limited by P, such as primary productivity.},

We studied the relationship between the distribution of tree species and environmental factors in the Sian Kaan Biosphere Reserve, south-eastern Mexico. Our main objective was to examine how changes in microtopography and edaphic factors influence the distribution of tree species of medium and low- statured forests. We established 17 plots of 625 m2 and collected data on spatial distribution of individuals with dbh 5 cm, and the following soil variables: electric conductivity (CE), cationic exchange capacity (CEC), textural class, pH, organic matter (MO), total nitrogen (Nt) and phosphorus availability (P). We used Twinspan to classify the plots and applied indirect (DCA) and direct (CCA) gradient analysis. We found 84 species and 4 433 individuals. MO, texture and CEC varied significantly (p0.05) between the high and low parts. DCA and CCA indicated that the species distribution is strongly influenced by the microtopography gradient and the textural class. Using DCA and CCA exclusively on the data of the low parts, two low statured forest types were identified: one characteristic of low zones (soil slightly basic and high percentage of clay), the other surrounded by medium statured forest (soil slightly acid, high CEC, MO and clay).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rapid determination of which nutrients limit the primary production of macroalgae and seagrasses is vital for understanding the impacts of eutrophication on marine and freshwater ecosystems. However, current methods to assess nutrient limitation are often cumbersome and time consuming. For phytoplankton, a rapid method has been described based on short-term changes in chlorophyll fluorescence upon nutrient addition, also known as Nutrient-Induced Fluorescence Transients (NIFTs). Thus far, though, the NIFT technique was not well suited for macroalgae and seagrasses. METHODOLOGY {\&} PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We developed a new experimental setup so that the NIFT technique can be used to assess nutrient limitation of benthic macroalgae and seagrasses. We first tested the applicability of the technique on sea lettuce (Ulva lactuca) cultured in the laboratory on nutrient-enriched medium without either nitrogen or phosphorus. Addition of the limiting nutrient resulted in a characteristic change in the fluorescence signal, whereas addition of non-limiting nutrients did not yield a response. Next, we applied the NIFT technique to field samples of the encrusting fan-leaf alga Lobophora variegata, one of the key algal species often involved in the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. The results pointed at co-limitation of L. variegata by phosphorus and nitrogen, although it responded more strongly to phosphate than to nitrate and ammonium addition. For turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) we found the opposite result, with a stronger NIFT response to nitrate and ammonium than to phosphate. CONCLUSIONS {\&} SIGNIFICANCE: Our extension of the NIFT technique offers an easy and fast method (30-60 min per sample) to determine nutrient limitation of macroalgae and seagrasses. We successfully applied this technique to macroalgae on coral reef ecosystems and to seagrass in a tropical inner bay, and foresee wider application to other aquatic plants, and to other marine and freshwater ecosystems.},

However, we lack empirical evidence to demonstrate the role of microbial community in driving soil respiration - a key ecosystem process for global sustainability and climate regulation. Here, we used a long-term field experiment including multiple management practices, to identify, via statistical modeling, the role of microbial community composition in influencing soil respiration. We analyzed major soil properties and microbial (both bacterial and fungal) abundance, diversity and community composition. We found that different management regimes led to different soil respiration rates. Most importantly, microbial community composition explained a unique portion of the variation in soil respiration, which cannot be accounted for by key respiration drivers such as soil properties and other microbial attributes (richness and total abundance). Microbial biomass and fungal richness were also identified as key drivers of soil respiration. Our results indicate that inclusions of microbial compositional data in Earth system models can be potentially used to improve our capacity to predict changes in soil C balance under changing environments.},

abstract = {Global soils store at least twice as much carbon as Earth's atmosphere. The global soil-to-atmosphere (or total soil respiration, RS) carbon dioxide (CO2) flux is increasing, but the degree to which climate change will stimulate carbon losses from soils as a result of heterotrophic respiration (RH) remains highly uncertain. Here we use an updated global soil respiration database9 to show that the observed soil surface RH:RS ratio increased significantly, from 0.54 to 0.63, between 1990 and 2014 (P = 0.009). Three additional lines of evidence provide support for this finding. By analysing two separate global gross primary production datasets, we find that the ratios of both RH and RS to gross primary production have increased over time. Similarly, significant increases in RH are observed against the longest available solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence global dataset, as well as gross primary production computed by an ensemble of global land models. We also show that the ratio of night-time net ecosystem exchange to gross primary production is rising across the FLUXNET2015 dataset. All trends are robust to sampling variability in ecosystem type, disturbance, methodology, CO2 fertilization effects and mean climate. Taken together, our findings provide observational evidence that global RH is rising, probably in response to environmental changes, consistent with meta-analyses and long-term experiments. This suggests that climate-driven losses of soil carbon are currently occurring across many ecosystems, with a detectable and sustained trend emerging at the global scale.},

abstract = {We still have a rudimentary understanding about the mechanism by which plant roots may stimulate soil microbial interactions. A biochemical model involving plant-derived biochemical fractions, such as exudates, has been used to explain this "rhizosphere effect" on bacteria. However, the variable response of other soil microbial groups, such as protozoa, to the rhizosphere suggests that other factors could be involved in shaping their communities. Thus, two experiments were designed to: (1) determine whether stimulatory and/or inhibiting factors associated with particular plant species regulate ciliate diversity and abundance and (2) obtain a better understanding about the mechanism by which these plant factors operate in the rhizosphere. Bacterial and chemical slurries were reciprocally exchanged between two plant species known to differ in terms of ciliate species richness and abundance (i.e., Canella winterana and plantation Tectona grandis). Analysis of variance showed that the bacteria plus nutrients and the nutrients only treatment had no significant effect on overall ciliate species richness and abundance when compared to the control treatment. However, the use of only colpodean species increased the taxonomic resolution of treatment effects revealing that bacterial slurries had a significant effect on colpodean ciliate species richness. Thus, for particular rhizosphere ciliates, biological properties, such as bacterial diversity or abundance, may have a strong influence on their diversity and possibly abundance. These results are consistent with a model of soil bacteria-mediated mutualisms between plants and protozoa.},

We replicated the eight factorial treatments four times using 32 plots of 40x40 m each. The addition of K was associated with significant decreases in stand-level fine-root biomass and, in a companion study of seedlings, decreases in allocation to roots and increases in height growth rates. The addition of K and N together was associated with significant increases in growth rates of saplings and poles (1-10 cm in diameter at breast height) and a further marginally significant decrease in stand-level fine-root biomass. The addition of P was associated with a marginally significant (P = 0.058) increase in fine-litter production that was consistent across all litter fractions. Our experiment provides evidence that N, P, and K all limit forest plants growing on a relatively fertile soil in the lowland tropics, with the strongest evidence for limitation by K among seedlings, saplings, and poles.},

We analyzed fossil coral reconstructions of ENSO spanning the past 7000 years from the Northern Line Islands, located in the center of action for ENSO. The corals document highly variable ENSO activity, with no evidence for a systematic trend in ENSO variance, which is contrary to some models that exhibit a response to insolation forcing over this same period. Twentieth-century ENSO variance is significantly higher than average fossil coral ENSO variance but is not unprecedented. Our results suggest that forced changes in ENSO, whether natural or anthropogenic, may be difficult to detect against a background of large internal variability.},

abstract = {Tree growth (as diameter increment), litterfall production, and litter biomass were studied in two secondary tropical dry forests of the Yucat{\'{a}}n Peninsula under four treatments of nutrient addition. The study's objective was to assess how variations in the nutrient supply affect aboveground net primary production and carbon (C) accumulation on the floor of two forests in different stages of regeneration. The study included an area of young forest (10 years old) with phosphorus (P)-poor soils and an area of old forest (around 60 years old) where soil P was comparatively less limiting. Four replicate plots (12 x 12 m) at each forest were either left intact (controls) or fertilized with nitrogen (N), P, or N plus P during 3 consecutive years. After 3 years of fertilization, relaxation of the constraints on nutrient limitation resulted in increased trunk growth rates at both the young and old forests. This effect was more pronounced with the addition of P or N plus P (trunk growth doubled with respect to controls), whereas N addition increased tree growth by 60{\%} in comparison to trees in plots without nutrient supplements. In both forests, there were no significant differences in litterfall production among treatments during the first 2 years after fertilization. In the 3rd year of nutrient addition, litterfall production was significantly higher in plots fertilized with N plus P compared to control plots at both forest sites; however, changes in litterfall were not accompanied by litter accumulation in the floor of the two forests. The results of this study support the hypothesis that there is nutrient limitation during tropical dry forest regeneration. They further show that it may be maintained in the long term during secondary succession.},

abstract = {The response of soil organic matter (OM) decomposition to increasing temperature is a critical aspect of ecosystem responses to global change. The impacts of climate warming on decomposition dynamics have not been resolved due to apparently contradictory results from field and lab experiments, most of which has focused on labile carbon with short turnover times. But the majority of total soil carbon stocks are comprised of organic carbon with turnover times of decades to centuries. Understanding the response of these carbon pools to climate change is essential for forecasting longer-term changes in soil carbon storage. Herein, we briefly synthesize information from recent studies that have been conducted using a wide variety of approaches. In our effort to understand research to-date, we derive a new conceptual model that explicitly identifies the processes controlling soil OM availability for decomposition and allows a more explicit description of the factors regulating OM decomposition under different circumstances. It explicitly defines resistance of soil OM to decomposition as being due either to its chemical conformation (quality) or its physico-chemical protection from decomposition. The former is embodied in the depolymerization process, the latter by adsorption/desorption and aggregate turnover. We hypothesize a strong role for variation in temperature sensitivity as a function of reaction rates for both. We conclude that important advances in understanding the temperature response of the processes that control substrate availability, depolymerization, microbial efficiency, and enzyme production will be needed to predict the fate of soil carbon stocks in a warmer world.},

abstract = {We applied fertilizers in a 23complete factorial design to determine the effects of nutrient amendments on plant growth in Hawaiian montane forests growing on two different volcanic substrates: ‘a‘a and pahoehoe lava. Both sites were about 140 years old and their overstories were nearly monospecific stands of Metrosideros polymorpha. Fertilizer applications included N, P, a mixture of essential macro- and micronutrients excepting P and N, and all combinations thereof in each of four blocks. Additions of nutrients other than N or P had no significant effects on measured plant-growth variables. In contrast, additions of either N or P significantly increased tree height growth, diameter increments, biomass growth, and height growth of the understory fern Dicranopteris linearis in both sites. The effect of N was greater than that of P. Greatest growth rates occurred in plots receiving both N and P, and signficant N*P interactions occurred in several cases, suggesting a synergistic effect between these two elements. Plant growth on these young, poorly weathered, basaltic lavas is colimited by N and P availability. Growth in a similar-aged stand growing on a mixture of volcanic ash and cinders is N but not P limited, indicating that the texture of the parent material influences nutrient-availability patterns during early primary succession.},

abstract = {There are pressing reasons for developing a better understanding of net primary production (NPP) in the world's forests. These ecosystems play a large role in the world's carbon budget, and their dynamics, which are likely to be responding to global changes in climate and atmospheric composition, have major economic implications and impacts on global biodiversity. Although there is a long history of forest NPP studies in the ecological literature, current understanding of ecosystem-level production remains limited. Forest NPP cannot be directly measured; it must be approached by indirect methods. To date, field measurements have been largely restricted to a few aspects of NPP; methods are still lacking for field assessment of others, and past studies have involved confusion about the types of measurements needed. As a result, existing field-based estimates of forest NPP are likely to be significant underestimates. In this paper we provide a conceptual framework to guide efforts toward improved estimates of forest NPP. We define the quantity NPP* as the summed classes of organic material that should be measured or estimated in field studies for an estimate of total NPP. We discuss the above- and belowground components of NPP* and the available methods for measuring them in the field. We then assess the implications of the limitations of past studies for current understanding of NPP in forest ecosystems, discuss how field NPP* measurements can be used to complement tower-based studies of forest carbon flux, and recommend design criteria for future field studies of forest NPP.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization has the potential to alter soil respiration temperature sensitivity (Q10) by changing soil biochemical and crop physiological process. A four-year field experiment was conducted to determine how Q10responded to these biochemical and physiological changes in rain-fed agro-ecosystems on the semi-arid Loess Plateau. Soil respiration, as well as biotic and abiotic factors were measured in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), with three fertilization treatments: (no fertilization (CK), 160 kg N hm− 1(N), and 160 kg N ha− 1with 39 kg P ha− 1(N + P). Mean annual soil respiration rate (calculated by averaging the four years) in the N treatment and N + P treatment was 18{\%} and 48{\%} higher than that in the CK treatment, respectively; and it was increased by 26{\%} (14{\%}–48{\%}) in the N + P treatment as compared with that in the N treatment. The decrease of Q10in the N and N + P treatments against the CK treatment was not stable for each year, ranging from 0.01 to 0.28. The maximum decrease of Q10in the N and N + P treatments was 10{\%} and 15{\%} in 2014–2015, while in other years the decrease of Q10was numerical but not significant. Soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) was increased by 10{\%} and 50{\%}, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) was increased by 6{\%} and 21{\%}, and photosynthesis rate was increased ranging from 6{\%} to 33{\%} with N and N + P fertilization. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and Chloroflexi were significantly higher by 32.9{\%}–54.1{\%} in N addition soils (N and N + P) compared to CK treatment, whereas additional P application into soils increased the relative abundance of the family Micrococcaceae, Nocardioidaceae and Chitinophagaceae. Soil respiration was positively related to SMBC, DOC and photosynthesis rate (p {\textless} 0.05). However, variation in Q10may be related to the increase of soil mineral N content and variation of the relative abundance of soil microbial community in our study. Nitrogen and additional phosphorus fertilization regimes affect soil respiration and temperature sensitivity differently.},

abstract = {Hormonal control of sexual maturation is a common feature in animal development. A particularly dramatic example is the metamorphosis of insects, in which pulses of the steroid hormone ecdysone drive the wholesale transformation of the larva into an adult. The mechanisms responsible for this transformation are not well understood. Work in Drosophila indicates that the larval and adult forms are patterned by the same underlying sets of developmental regulators, but it is not understood how the same regulators pattern two distinct forms. Recent studies indicate that this ability is facilitated by a global change in the responsiveness of target genes during metamorphosis. Here we show that this shift is controlled in part by the ecdysone-induced transcription factor E93. Although long considered a dedicated regulator of larval cell death, we find that E93 is expressed widely in adult cells at the pupal stage and is required for many patterning processes at this time. To understand the role of E93 in adult patterning, we focused on a simple E93-dependent process, the induction of the Dll gene within bract cells of the pupal leg by EGF receptor signaling. In this system, we show that E93 functions to cause Dll to become responsive to EGF receptor signaling. We demonstrate that E93 is both necessary and sufficient for directing this switch. E93 likely controls the responsiveness of many other target genes because it is required broadly for patterning during metamorphosis. The wide conservation of E93 orthologs suggests that similar mechanisms control life-cycle transitions in other organisms, including vertebrates.},

abstract = {The temperature sensitivity of soil respiration is a main factor determining the response of global terrestrial soil carbon to global warming and, consequently, its feedback on atmospheric CO2concentrations. A data synthesis was performed to summarize information available in the literature on the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration obtained in laboratory soil incubations and expressed as Q10. The influence of common experimental variables and methods, i.e. range of incubation temperatures, length of incubation, calculation methods, and amounts of soil organic carbon, was analyzed.We found a small but significant difference between the Q10values calculated with different experimental methods as well as time-related trends showing an initial decrease followed by stable values. Q10values ranged from 0.5 to over 300 and were negatively correlated with temperature, but only at the range of temperatures below 25 °C. A similar dependence of the activation energy (derived from the Arrhenius equation) with temperature was observed. A negative relationship with total organic carbon content of soils was found in forest and grassland ecosystems, with an average decrease in Q10of 0.02 mgC g-1soil, explaining their slightly lower mean Q10s compared to cultivated soils. Because most of the observed variability remained unexplained, we emphasize the need for new approaches in future studies to the problem of understanding the temperature sensitivity of soil organic matter decomposition. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Weedon2013,
abstract = {Northern peatlands constitute an important component of the global carbon (C) cycle due to their long-term accumulation of soil organic matter. This function as a carbon sink is partly dependent on low temperatures limiting decomposition and nutrient cycling, so global warming has the potential to alter the C balance of these systems and feedback to climate change. Field observations have shown that peatland organic matter decomposition, ecosystem respiration and nitrogen cycling are closely related processes that show a large degree of temperature sensitivity. In the current study, we investigated whether seasonal dynamics of substrate input may be an indirect mechanism accounting for this observed sensitivity. We carried out a 60-day mesocosm incubation experiment with sub-arctic peat soil to compare the direct effects of temperature increase with the indirect effects of increased microbial- or plant-derived organic matter input on key soil C and N cycling processes and substrate pools. Additions of dead microbial cells led to an 83{\%} increase in organic N pool sizes, 16-64{\%} increases in the potential activities of most soil enzymes, a transient increase in the relative abundance of $\beta$-proteobacteria, and a decrease in the relative abundance of $\alpha$-proteo-, Actino- and Acido-bacteria. Neither the addition of plant root litter, nor a 5 °C alteration in incubation temperatures, had comparable effects on these parameters. Peat respiration was positively affected by both substrate addition (20-46{\%} increase) and higher incubation temperatures (34-38{\%} increase), but the temperature-only effect was not sufficient to account for the increases in respiration observed in field experiments. Thus, it appears that warming effects on C and N cycle processes can potentially be driven by indirect effects, with alterations to the seasonal flux of microbe-derived organic matter a particularly potent mechanism. The high temperature sensitivity of decomposition and respiration may therefore be largely a result of warming-induced changes in substrate supply rates. We propose that climate change models of soil carbon and nitrogen cycling should seek to incorporate realistic microbial biomass dynamics. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Tropical forests have high rates of soil carbon cycling, but little information is available on how roots, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and free-living microorganisms interact and influence organic matter mineralization in these ecosystems. We used mesh ingrowth cores and isotopic tracers in phospholipid fatty acid biomarkers to investigate the effects of roots and AMF mycelia on (1) microbial community composition, microbial carbon utilization, and hydrolytic enzyme activities for large, potted tropical trees and (2) enzyme activities and litter mass loss in a lowland tropical forest. Under the tropical tree, plant-derived carbon was incorporated predominantly into bacterial groups in both rhizosphere and AMF-only soils. Gram-positive bacteria incorporated additional soil-derived carbon in rhizosphere soils, which also contained the highest microbial biomass. For hydrolytic enzymes, $\beta$-glucosidase and N-acetyl $\beta$-glucosaminidase activities were highest in rhizosphere soils, while phosphomonoesterase activity was highest in AMF-only soil. In the forest, leaf litter mass loss was increased by the presence of roots, but not by the presence of AMF mycelia only. Root–microbial interactions influenced organic matter cycling, with evidence for rhizosphere priming and accelerated leaf litter decomposition in the presence of roots. Although AMF mycelia alone did not stimulate organic matter mineralization, they were a conduit of carbon to other soil microorganisms.},

abstract = {Most vegetation is limited in productivity by nutrient availability, but the magnitude of limitation globally is not known. Nutrient limitation is directly relevant not only to ecology and agriculture, but also to the global carbon cycle by regulating how much atmospheric CO2 the terrestrial biosphere can sequester. We attempt to identify total nutrient limitation in terrestrial plant productivity globally using ecophysiological theory and new developments in remote sensing for evapotranspiration and plant productivity. Our map of nutrient limitation qualitatively reproduces known regional nutrient gradients (e.g., across Amazonia), highlights differences in nutrient addition to croplands (e.g., between “developed” and “developing” countries), identifies the role of nutrients on the distribution of major biomes (e.g., tree line migration in boreal North America), and compares similarly to a ground-based test along the Long Substrate Age Gradient in Hawaii, U.S.A. (e.g., foliar and soil nutrients, litter decomposition). Nonetheless, challenges in representing light and water use efficiencies, disturbance, and comparison to ground data with multiple interacting nutrients provide avenues for further progress on refining such a global map. Global average reduction in terrestrial plant productivity was within 16–28{\%}, depending on treatment of disturbance; these values can be compared to global carbon cycle model estimates of carbon uptake reduction with nutrient cycle inclusion.},

abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) depositions are expected to increase in the tropics as a consequence of increasing human activities in the next decades. In the literature, it is frequently assumed that tropical montane forests are N-limited, while tropical lowland forests are P-limited. In a low-level N and P addition experiment, we determined the short-term response of N and P cycles in a north Andean montane forest on Palaeozoic shists and metasandstones at an elevation of 2100m a.s.l. to increased N and P inputs. We evaluated experimental N, P and N+P additions (50kgha-1yr-1 of N, 10kgha-1yr-1 of P and 50kg+10kgha-1yr-1 of N and P, respectively) and an untreated control in a fourfold replicated randomized block design. We collected litter leachate, mineral soil solution (0.15 and 0.30m depths), throughfall and litterfall before the treatment began (August 2007) until 16 months after the first nutrient application (April 2009). Less than 10 and 1{\%} of the applied N and P, respectively, leached below the organic layer which contained almost all roots and no significant leaching losses of N and P occurred to below 0.15m mineral soil depth. Deposited N and P from the atmosphere in dry and wet form were retained in the canopy of the control treatment using a canopy budget model. Nitrogen and P retention by the canopy were reduced and N and P fluxes in throughfall and litterfall increased in their respective treatments. The increase in N and P fluxes in throughfall after fertilization was equivalent to 2.5{\%} of the applied N and 2{\%} of the applied P. The fluxes of N and P in litterfall were up to 15{\%} and 3{\%}, respectively, higher in the N and N+P than in the control treatments. We conclude that the expected elevated N and P deposition in the tropics will be retained in the ecosystem, at least in the short term and hence, N and P concentrations in stream water will not increase. Our results suggest that in the studied tropical montane forest ecosystem on Palaeozoic bedrock, N and P are co-limiting the growth of organisms in the canopy and organic layer. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {1. Nutrients are a critical resource for plant growth, but the elements limiting growth in tropical forests have rarely been determined. 2. We investigated the influence of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and micronutrients on seedling biomass and nutrient allocation in a factorial nutrient fertilization experiment in lowland tropical forest at the Barro Colorado Nature Monument, Panama. We also measured 8 years of herbivory and growth for 1800 seedlings. We sought to determine the identity of limiting elements and possible nutrient interactions. 3. The five study species were Alseis blackiana, Desmopsis panamensis, Heisteria concinna, Sorocea affinis and Tetragastris panamensis. Plants grew in deeply shaded understorey with a mean canopy openness of 4.9{\%} (±0.7{\%}; 1 SE). 4. Tissue N concentration increased by 11{\%} with N addition. Tissue P concentration increased by 16{\%} with P addition. Tissue K increased by 4{\%} with K addition. K addition reduced root-to-shoot biomass ratio. There was no significant effect of fertilization on specific leaf area or leaf area ratio. 5. The proportion of leaves damaged and the mean level of damage by herbivory increased with P and K addition and showed a significant P × K interaction. 6.7ensp;Across all species and years, relative growth rate of height increased with K addition and with N and P in combination. Relative growth rate of leaf count trended 8.5{\%} higher with K addition (P = 0.076). 7. We also added micronutrients in a parallel experiment. There was no effect of micronutrient addition on any seedling parameter. 8. Synthesis. K addition affected seedlings by enhancing tissue nutrient concentration, increasing herbivory, reducing root-to-shoot biomass ratio and increasing height growth. Additional effects of N or P on tissue chemistry, herbivory and growth offer support for the multiple limiting resources hypothesis. Our results suggest that seedling growth is limited by nutrients, especially K, even under highly shaded conditions in this lowland tropical forest.},

abstract = {The suitability of the foliar N/P ratio was evaluated as a predictor of nutrient limitation in an alpine ecosystem of the Colorado Front Range. We hypothesized that foliar N/P ratios are directly correlated with the alpine soil nutrient status. We used a long-term fertilization experiment conducted in three alpine plant communities, where 48 plots were established consisting of four replicates of control, N, P, and N + P additions. We characterized four extractable P fractions, maximum P sorption capacity and extractable NO3-N and NH4-N, measured N and P adsorption fluxes, determined the soil moisture content, and measured the total N and P concentrations in soils and below- and aboveground plant material. The fertilized plots exhibited significantly higher nutrient concentrations in above- and belowground plant materials and adsorption fluxes of N and P (P {\textless} 0.001 for all additions) than the control plots. The N-added plots were significantly acidified ({\textless}3.8) vs. the control plots ({\textgreater}4.14), which may have partially contributed to increased P flux. A correlation analysis showed that N and P accumulations in aboveground plant material could not be predicted by the traditional extractable N and P tests. Nutrient adsorption flux measurements and especially P showed better correlation with nutrient accumulation in below- and aboveground plant material (r = 0.53 and 0.43, respectively, P {\textless} 0.001). This moderate correlation suggested, however, that the N/P ratio index is somewhat limited in providing a definitive answer for the nutrient limitation status of this alpine ecosystem},

abstract = {The concentration, stoichiometry and resorption of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in plant leaves are often used as proxies of the availability of these growth-limiting nutrients, but the responses of these metrics to changes in nutrient availability remain largely untested for tropical forest trees. We evaluated changes in N and P concentrations, N/P ratios and resorption for four common tree species after 13 years of factorial N and P additions in a lowland tropical forest in Panama. Chronic P addition increased foliar P concentrations, decreased P resorption proficiency and decreased N/P ratios in three locally common eudicot tree species (Alseis blackiana, Heisteria concinna, Tetragastris panamensis). The increase in foliar P involved similar proportional increases in organic and inorganic P in two species and a disproportionately large increase in inorganic P in A. blackiana. Nitrogen addition did not alter foliar N concentrations in any species, but did decrease N resorption proficiency in H. concinna. A fourth species, the palm Oenocarpus mapora, demonstrated remarkably static foliar nutrient concentrations, responding only with a marginal decrease in P resorption proficiency under N plus P co-addition. Synthesis. Collectively, these results suggest that adjustment of N/P ratios can be expected in eudicots exposed to elevated P, but foliar N appears to already be at optimal levels in these lowland rain forest tree species. The complexity of species-specific responses to altered nutrient availability highlights the difficulty in predicting future responses of tropical forest trees to a changing world.

abstract = {Currently, it is unknown what role tropical forest soils will play in the future global carbon cycle under higher temperatures. Many tropical forests grow on deeply weathered soils and although it is generally accepted that soil carbon decomposition increases with higher temperatures, it is not known whether subsurface carbon pools are particularly responsive to increasing soil temperatures. Carbon dioxide (CO2) diffusing out of soils is an important flux in the global carbon. Although soil CO2 efflux has been the subject of many studies in recent years, it remains difficult to deduct controls of this flux because of the different sources that produce CO2 and because potential environmental controls like soil temperature and soil moisture often covary. Here, we report results of a 5-year study in which we measured soil CO2 production on two deeply weathered soil types at different depths in an old-growth tropical wet forest in Costa Rica. Three sites were developed on old river terraces (old alluvium) and the other three were developed on old lava flows (residual). Annual soil CO2 efflux varied between 2.8-3.6 mu mol CO2-C m(-2) s(-1) (old alluvium) and 3.4-3.9 mu mol CO2-C m(-2) s(-1) (residual). More than 75{\%} of the CO2 was produced in the upper 0.5 m (including litter layer) and less than 7{\%} originated from the soil below 1 m depth. This low contribution was explained by the lack of water stress in this tropical wet forest which has resulted in very low root biomass below 2 m depth. In the top 0.5 m CO2 production was positively correlated with both temperature and soil moisture; between 0.6 and 2 m depth CO2 production correlated negatively with soil moisture in one soil and positively with photosynthetically active radiation in the other soil type. Below 2 m soil CO2 production strongly increased with increasing temperature. In combination with reduced tree growth that has been shown for this ecosystem, this would be a strong positive feedback to ecosystem warming.},

abstract = {Microbial communities and their associated enzyme activities affect the amount and chemical quality of carbon (C) in soils. Increasing nitrogen (N) deposition, particularly in N-rich tropical forests, is likely to change the composition and behavior of microbial communities and feed back on ecosystem structure and function. This study presents a novel assessment of mechanistic links between microbial responses to N deposition and shifts in soil organic matter (SOM) quality and quantity. We used phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis and microbial enzyme assays in soils to assess microbial community responses to long-term N additions in two distinct tropical rain forests. We used soil density fractionation and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to measure related changes in SOM pool sizes and chemical quality. Microbial biomass increased in response to N fertilization in both tropical forests and corresponded to declines in pools of low-density SOM. The chemical quality of this soil C pool reflected ecosystem-specific changes in microbial community composition. In the lower-elevation forest, there was an increase in gram-negative bacteria PLFA biomass, and there were significant losses of labile C chemical groups (O-alkyls). In contrast, the upper-elevation tropical forest had an increase in fungal PLFAs with N additions and declines in C groups associated with increased soil C storage (alkyls). The dynamics of microbial enzymatic activities with N addition provided a functional link between changes in microbial community structure and SOM chemistry. Ecosystem-specific changes in microbial community composition are likely to have far-reaching effects on soil carbon storage and cycling. This study indicates that microbial communities in N-rich tropical forests can be sensitive to added N, but we can expect significant variability in how ecosystem structure and function respond to N deposition among tropical forest types.},

Using a hemiparasitic plant that takes up secondary compounds from host plants, I experimentally manipulated secondary compounds in planta and assessed their effects on herbivores and pollinators in the field. Here, I show that the uptake of alkaloids in the annual hemiparasite Castilleja indivisa resulted in decreased herbivory, increased visitation by pollinators, and increased lifetime seed production. These results indicate that resistance traits such as alkaloids can increase plant fitness directly by reducing herbivore attack and indirectly by increasing pollinator visitation to defended plants. Thus, selection for production of secondary compounds may be underestimated by considering only the direct effect of herbivores on plant fitness.},

@article{Karhu2010,
abstract = {Controversial conclusions from different studies suggest that the decomposition of old soil organic matter (SOM) is either more, less, or equally temperature sensitive compared to the younger SOM. Based on chemical kinetic theory, the decomposition of more recalcitrant materials should be more temperature sensitive, unless environmental factors limit decomposition. Here, we show results for boreal upland forest soils supporting this hypothesis. We detected differences in the temperature sensitivity 1) between soil layers varying in their decomposition stage and SOM quality, and 2) inside the layers during a 495 day laboratory incubation. Temperature sensitivity increased with increasing soil depth and decreasing SOM quality. In the organic layers, temperature sensitivity of decomposition increased during the early part of a 495 day laboratory incubation, after respiration rate and SOM quality had notably decreased. This indicates that decomposition of recalcitrant compounds was more temperature sensitive than that of the labile ones. Our results imply that Q10values for total heterotrophic soil respiration determined from short-term laboratory incubations can either underestimate or overestimate the temperature sensitivity of SOM decomposition, depending on soil layer, initial labile carbon content and temperature range used for the measurements. Using Q10values that ignore these factors in global climate models provides erroneous estimates on the effects of climate change on soil carbon storage. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Rowlings2012,
abstract = {The temporal variations in CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured over two consecutive years from February 2007 to March 2009 from a subtropical rainforest in south-eastern Queensland, Australia, using an automated sampling system. A concurrent study using an additional 30 manual chambers examined the spatial variability of emissions distributed across three nearby remnant rainforest sites with similar vegetation and climatic conditions. Interannual variation in fluxes of all gases over the 2 years was minimal, despite large discrepancies in rainfall, whereas a pronounced seasonal variation could only be observed for CO2 fluxes. High infiltration, drainage and subsequent high soil aeration under the rainforest limited N2O loss while promoting substantial CH4 uptake. The average annual N2O loss of 0.5 ± 0.1 kg N2O-N ha−1 over the 2-year measurement period was at the lower end of reported fluxes from rainforest soils. The rainforest soil functioned as a sink for atmospheric CH4 throughout the entire 2-year period, despite periods of substantial rainfall. A clear linear correlation between soil moisture and CH4 uptake was found. Rates of uptake ranged from greater than 15 g CH4-C ha−1 day−1 during extended dry periods to less than 2-5 g CH4-C ha−1 day−1 when soil water content was high. The calculated annual CH4 uptake at the site was 3.65 kg CH4-C ha−1 yr−1. This is amongst the highest reported for rainforest systems, reiterating the ability of aerated subtropical rainforests to act as substantial sinks of CH4. The spatial study showed N2O fluxes almost eight times higher, and CH4 uptake reduced by over one-third, as clay content of the rainforest soil increased from 12{\%} to more than 23{\%}. This demonstrates that for some rainforest ecosystems, soil texture and related water infiltration and drainage capacity constraints may play a more important role in controlling fluxes than either vegetation or seasonal variability.},

@article{Wang2017a,
abstract = {Understanding the response of heterotrophic (Rh) and autotrophic (Ra) components of soil respiration (Rs) to fertilization is important to evaluate the effects of management practices on soil carbon cycling in plantation forest ecosystems. Therefore, we investigated Ra and Rh using a trenching method in a young Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation, subjected to N and P fertilization in subtropical China. Soil CO2efflux was measured from December 2013 to November 2015. Mean annual Rs, Ra, and Rh rates decreased on average by 18.6{\%}, 23.6{\%}, and 17.1{\%} after fertilization. The contribution of Rh to Rs ranged from 70.9{\%} to 76.7{\%}. This contribution was greater in P-fertilized plots, suggesting that fertilization changed the contribution of Rh and Ra to Rs. The reduced rate of Rh induced by fertilization contributed on average 66.9{\%} to the decrease in Rs rate. This contribution for Rh was higher in NP-fertilized plots than in other plots Based on a bivariate model, 51.2{\%}–69.3{\%} and 53.6{\%}–66.7{\%} of the variations in Rs and Rh among different treatments were explained by soil temperature and moisture. However, temperature sensitivity of Rs and Rh were not affected by fertilization. Ra and Rh were positively related to fine root biomass. Rh was also positively related to soil organic C, dissolved organic C, and microbial biomass C, but negatively related to soil mineral N content. Our results highlight the importance of fertilization on soil CO2efflux and its significance to the estimation of forest C sink potential.},
